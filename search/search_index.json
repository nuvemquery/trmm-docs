We are facing significant challenges due to the stringent policies of antivirus companies. Antivirus software is a critical tool for safeguarding Windows systems against viruses, trojans, and other malicious threats. However, the aggressive approach of some antivirus companies towards virus and trojan protection often results in legitimate software, such as Tactical RMM, being misclassified as malware. For instance, Tactical RMM is designed to assist IT professionals and system administrators in managing and monitoring systems remotely. This, while essential for operational efficiency and security, can sometimes be flagged by antivirus solutions as potential threats. This classification occurs despite the primary use of Tactical RMM for legitimate, constructive purposes. The rationale behind such decisions is that if a tool could potentially be leveraged for malicious activities, it must be treated as a threat. This stance overlooks the reality that the majority of users employ these tools for valid and positive reasons. Some antivirus companies adopt a slightly more nuanced approach by labeling these tools as \"Security Threats\" or \"Riskware.\" While this is a less severe classification than labeling them as viruses or trojans, it still hinders users by quarantining or deleting the tools, effectively preventing their use. Moreover, the distinction between \"Virus\" and \"Riskware\" is lost on many users, leading to confusion and undue concern and why do they not class other RMMs the same? The issue of overzealous protection is not unique to Tactical RMM. Other developers, both small and large, encounter similar problems with antivirus software flagging their products without clear justification. Examples include utilities that do not even involve password recovery or system monitoring but still face unwarranted scrutiny and restriction. Infact we can see NirSoft 15 years ago wrote a similar blog about this. The challenge extends beyond individual developers to affect the broader ecosystem. Small developers, in particular, struggle with the ramifications of these false positives, lacking the resources and legal clout that larger companies possess to quickly address and resolve these issues. To mitigate these challenges, it is crucial for both users and developers to engage more proactively with antivirus companies. This involves reporting false positives, providing feedback on software classifications, and advocating for a more balanced approach that recognizes the legitimate use of Tactical RMM. Ultimately, greater awareness and communication can help ensure that essential tools are not unjustly penalized, supporting a more secure and efficient digital environment. Remember YOU are the antivirus companies customer, YOU by reporting these false positives can help! At the moment, Microsoft Windows Defender thinks a go executable with virtually nothing in it is the \"Trojan:Win32/Wacatac.B!ml\" virus https://old.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/s1bh01/goexecutables_and_windows_defender/ . Windows Defender ranks as one of the top AVs and can be largely controlled via Tactical. Read more about Defender detection rates etc here . Use the Defender Status Report script (Task > Run Daily - Use Automation manager) to monitor machines: https://github.com/amidaware/community-scripts/blob/main/scripts/Win_Defender_Status_Report.ps1 . If you want to lock a system down, run the Defender Enable script (test in your environment, because it can stop Microsoft Office from opening docs among MANY other things) that will turn on Protected Folders: https://github.com/amidaware/community-scripts/blob/main/scripts/Win_Defender_Enable.ps1 and you will be extremely safe. Annoyed, and unable to do lots of dangerous things like opening files from the internet and email...but safe. Use this as an Exclusion List for Protected Folders items. Be aware there is also a PowerShell script to add TRMM exclusions specific to Windows Defender. Is Code Signing worth it?

We are facing significant challenges due to the stringent policies of antivirus companies. Antivirus software is a critical tool for safeguarding Windows systems against viruses, trojans, and other malicious threats. However, the aggressive approach of some antivirus companies towards virus and trojan protection often results in legitimate software, such as Tactical RMM, being misclassified as malware. For instance, Tactical RMM is designed to assist IT professionals and system administrators in managing and monitoring systems remotely. This, while essential for operational efficiency and security, can sometimes be flagged by antivirus solutions as potential threats. This classification occurs despite the primary use of Tactical RMM for legitimate, constructive purposes. The rationale behind such decisions is that if a tool could potentially be leveraged for malicious activities, it must be treated as a threat. This stance overlooks the reality that the majority of users employ these tools for valid and positive reasons. Some antivirus companies adopt a slightly more nuanced approach by labeling these tools as \"Security Threats\" or \"Riskware.\" While this is a less severe classification than labeling them as viruses or trojans, it still hinders users by quarantining or deleting the tools, effectively preventing their use. Moreover, the distinction between \"Virus\" and \"Riskware\" is lost on many users, leading to confusion and undue concern and why do they not class other RMMs the same? The issue of overzealous protection is not unique to Tactical RMM. Other developers, both small and large, encounter similar problems with antivirus software flagging their products without clear justification. Examples include utilities that do not even involve password recovery or system monitoring but still face unwarranted scrutiny and restriction. Infact we can see NirSoft 15 years ago wrote a similar blog about this. The challenge extends beyond individual developers to affect the broader ecosystem. Small developers, in particular, struggle with the ramifications of these false positives, lacking the resources and legal clout that larger companies possess to quickly address and resolve these issues. To mitigate these challenges, it is crucial for both users and developers to engage more proactively with antivirus companies. This involves reporting false positives, providing feedback on software classifications, and advocating for a more balanced approach that recognizes the legitimate use of Tactical RMM. Ultimately, greater awareness and communication can help ensure that essential tools are not unjustly penalized, supporting a more secure and efficient digital environment. Remember YOU are the antivirus companies customer, YOU by reporting these false positives can help! At the moment, Microsoft Windows Defender thinks a go executable with virtually nothing in it is the \"Trojan:Win32/Wacatac.B!ml\" virus https://old.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/s1bh01/goexecutables_and_windows_defender/ . Windows Defender ranks as one of the top AVs and can be largely controlled via Tactical. Read more about Defender detection rates etc here . Use the Defender Status Report script (Task > Run Daily - Use Automation manager) to monitor machines: https://github.com/amidaware/community-scripts/blob/main/scripts/Win_Defender_Status_Report.ps1 .

Annoyed, and unable to do lots of dangerous things like opening files from the internet and email...but safe. Use this as an Exclusion List for Protected Folders items.

How does it work? \u00b6 Every time you generate an agent or an agent does a self-update, your self-hosted instance sends a request to Tactical's code signing servers with your auth token. If the token is valid, the server sends you back a code signed agent. If not, it sends you back the un-signed agent. If you think your auth token has been compromised or stolen then please open a ticket to get a new token / invalidate the old one. Why should I pay for Code Signing? \u00b6 Code signing costs a lot of money. OV code signing requires a legitimate legal business...Amidaware was setup for this purpose. Code signing + operating a business costs thousands of dollars a year. It helps the project move forward and it can supports devs spending time on it, they have lives, wives, jobs and kids which all demands attention. It should stop bad actors using it maliciously. It helps with Antivirus products detecting it as being malicious. Tactical RMM is getting flagged as PUA or virus, will this fix it? \u00b6 Getting a code signed agent helps, but it is not guaranteed to eliminate this entirely. This is because AVs are unpredictable, changing all the time, constantly making new decisions and rules, telling you one thing and doing another, all doing different things in slightly different ways, etc. However, the best way to submit a whitelisting request to your AV for the TRMM agent... is having a code signed exe to submit.

This change has been prompted by industry-wide modifications to code signing practices, which now necessitate the use of hardware tokens or HSMs (Hardware Security Modules). These requirements make it unfeasible for us to continue using our Digicert code signing certificate for signing these dynamically generated installers. While we have already transitioned to using Digicert's HSM to store our private key, this approach now incurs a cost for each executable signed. Given the volume of dynamic EXEs we currently generate and sign for all our customers, currently around 250,000 per month as of May 2024, this would result in costs around $62,000.00 USD per month\u2014an unsustainable increase from the previously nonexistent cost. Please note that the Inno Setup installer ( tacticalagent-vX.X.X-windows-arch.exe ), utilized by both the Powershell and Manual installation methods, as well as the agent update method, will continue to be signed with our Digicert OV code signing certificate. The tacticalrmm.exe agent binary will also continue being signed with our Digicert OV cert.

Contributing using GitHub Codespaces \u00b6 Devcontainers is an open specification for developing with a preconfigured container setup. With devcontainers, you don't need SSH keys, git clone , or deal with the usual \"local setup\" tasks. Everything is configured in the container and you connect to it remotely. GitHub Codespaces is GitHub's version of devcontainers. Authentication is provided via your GitHub account. Before you start a Codespace, there are a few settings you should to be aware of. Cost and spending limit \u00b6 GitHub provides 120 core hours and 15 GB-month storage for free accounts. Please read GitHub's notes in detail to understand how much that provides. For clarity, here is the explanation of GB-month storage and core hour compute usage. The GB-month unit of storage is a time-based measurement, 1 GB-month being 1 GB of storage usage for one whole month. The disk space used by all of your codespaces and prebuilds is assessed once an hour and your current GB-month usage is recalculated. Therefore, while you have codespaces and prebuilds, your GB-month usage will increase throughout the month. For example, if the storage totals 15 GB, and remains unchanged throughout your monthly billing cycle, then you will have used 7.5 GB halfway through the month, and 15 GB at the end of the month. For more information, see \"About billing for storage usage\" later in this article. A \"core hour\" is a measure used for included compute usage. To calculate core hours, multiply the number of hours for which a codespace has been active by the multiplier in the pricing table later in this article. For the basic machine types, the multiplier is the number of processor cores in the machine that hosts the codespace. For example, if you use a 2-core machine for your codespace and it's active for an hour, you have used 2 core hours. If you use an 8-core machine for an hour, you have used 8 core hours. If you use an 8-core machine for two hours, you have used 16 core hours. By default, the spending limit is $0. This means the devcontainer will stop after the free tier has been exhausted. Creating the codespace \u00b6 Codespaces are created by clicking the code button and then the Codespaces tab. Codespaces are specific to a branch! If needed, create a new branch for your changes. Clicking the + will create the Codespace. Codespaces are paid for by you using the spencing limit mentioned above. This screenshot is from my account where I already have a codespace on this branch, scaling pancake . Using the Codespace \u00b6 It takes about 15 seconds for the Codespace to start in the browser. If you want to use Code on the desktop, click the Codespaces in the lower left corner (to open the command menu at top) and selection the option to \"Open in VS Code Desktop\". Once VS Code is open on the desktop, you can close the browser tab. Committing your code \u00b6 As stated above, you don't need SSH keys to commit your changes. The Codespace is already authenticated with your GitHub account, and git push \"just works(tm)\". Of course you still need to git add --update or git add . followed by git commit --message \"Some descriptive message for your change\" .

With devcontainers, you don't need SSH keys, git clone , or deal with the usual \"local setup\" tasks. Everything is configured in the container and you connect to it remotely. GitHub Codespaces is GitHub's version of devcontainers. Authentication is provided via your GitHub account.

Please read GitHub's notes in detail to understand how much that provides. For clarity, here is the explanation of GB-month storage and core hour compute usage. The GB-month unit of storage is a time-based measurement, 1 GB-month being 1 GB of storage usage for one whole month. The disk space used by all of your codespaces and prebuilds is assessed once an hour and your current GB-month usage is recalculated. Therefore, while you have codespaces and prebuilds, your GB-month usage will increase throughout the month. For example, if the storage totals 15 GB, and remains unchanged throughout your monthly billing cycle, then you will have used 7.5 GB halfway through the month, and 15 GB at the end of the month. For more information, see \"About billing for storage usage\" later in this article. A \"core hour\" is a measure used for included compute usage. To calculate core hours, multiply the number of hours for which a codespace has been active by the multiplier in the pricing table later in this article. For the basic machine types, the multiplier is the number of processor cores in the machine that hosts the codespace. For example, if you use a 2-core machine for your codespace and it's active for an hour, you have used 2 core hours. If you use an 8-core machine for an hour, you have used 8 core hours. If you use an 8-core machine for two hours, you have used 16 core hours. By default, the spending limit is $0. This means the devcontainer will stop after the free tier has been exhausted.","title":"Cost and spending limit"},{"location":"contributing/#creating-the-codespace","text":"Codespaces are created by clicking the code button and then the Codespaces tab.

Please contact Commercial Support to discuss further. Why isn't the Code Signing free? \u00b6 It is recommended because it helps the project mature, Tactical is source available and free. Community support is also free on top of this we have spent a lot of time developing the docs, please follow them! With many source available (and similar) projects devs get bored of them because they don't make money out of it. So here is your reasons to pay for code signing and also why it was discussed and implemented. Code signing costs a lot of money. OV code signing requires a legitimate legal business...Amidaware was setup for this purpose. Code signing + operating a business costs thousands of dollars a year. It helps the project move forward and it can support devs spending time on it, they have lives, wives, jobs and kids which all demands attention. It should stop bad actors using it maliciously. It helps with AVs detecting it as anything malicious. We had github sponsors up for many months before code signing. Very few people donated, some $5 and $10. maybe $40 a month. Once we announced code signing, sponsors came in like crazy, and many people upgraded their $5 to $55 so whilst everyone believes people would gladly donate, that's just not the case. We already tried. Is Tactical RMM Compliant with Privacy Laws? \u00b6 Tactical, as a self-hosted solution, offers the potential for GDPR and HIPAA compliance as well as many other privacy laws, but its adherence largely depends on the hosting environment and how it's configured. Since you have full control over the hosting, you bear a significant responsibility for compliance. By default, the Tactical server collects essential information which is displayed in the dashboard on each agent. None of this data is transmitted outside of the Tactical server, enhancing data security. Encryption at rest is possible at the file system level, contingent on your hosting infrastructure. Additionally, all communications between the Tactical server and your clients are encrypted in transit, enhancing security. Furthermore, Tactical incorporates an audit log that records all actions, assisting in tracking and ensuring accountability. However, it's crucial to be cautious about collector scripts, as they could potentially alter data collection practices, potentially leading to non-compliance if not carefully managed and configured in accordance with GDPR and HIPAA regulations. Therefore, maintaining a vigilant approach to configuration and monitoring is essential when utilizing Tactical for compliance purposes. Linux/macOS Agents \u00b6 Why do I see? Missing code signing token 400: Bad Request You must have a paid code signing certificate while Linux/macOS support is in the post-alpha/beta: Code signing makes these installs easy and is a benefit offered to code signing sponsors. So become a sponsor and enjoy the easy life DIYer can read thru the code and... DIY. This is primarily for 2 reasons: As this has been a sponsorship goal it seems only fair that those who contributed to make this a reality get early access to easy agent installs. We're looking for good bug reports from active users to get these agent into production ready code. Who is Amidaware Inc? \u00b6 The Legal entity behind Tactical RMM. How do I move an agent to another client/site? \u00b6 Right click on the agent > Edit agent. Then select the new site from the dropdown. Is it possible to use XXX with Tactical RMM \u00b6 While it may be possible to use XXX, we have not configured it and therefore it is Unsupported . We cannot help you configure XXX as it pertains to your environment . Is it possible to use XXX proxy server with Tactical RMM \u00b6 If you wish to stray from the easy install of a standard install in a VPS, you need to have the knowledge on how to troubleshoot your own custom environment. The most common reasons you're running a proxy are: Because you only have a single public IP and you already have something on Port 443. Workaround : Get another public IP from your ISP. Because you want to monitor traffic for security reasons: You're a Networking Wizard . There are some implementations that others have done, but be aware it is Unsupported and if you're requesting help in Discord please let us know in advance. I want to use a different port other than 443 \u00b6 I want to use a different port for Tactical RMM because my public IP on 443 is currently being used by something else. PAT (aka Port Address Translation) That is not possible at this time. Your options are: Run in a VPS Get another Public IP from your ISP Use another proxy server in an unsupported configuration Run TRMM in a SDWAN like Netmaker/Zerotier/Tailscale/Sunbird etc How do I do X feature in the web UI? \u00b6 A lot of features in the web UI are hidden behind right-click menus. Almost everything has a right click menu so if you don't see something, try right clicking on it. Can I run Tactical RMM locally behind NAT without exposing my RMM server to the internet? \u00b6 Yes, you will just need to setup local DNS for the 3 subdomains, either by editing host files on all your agents or through a local DNS server. Similarly asked: Can I use onsite DNS servers (I don\u2019t want my server accessible from the internet). Yes, you can use (only) internal DNS (if you want) for api, mesh and rmm domains. You don't have to put these records in your public DNS servers. The Let's Encrypt DNS TXT wildcard cert request process does not require any inbound connection from the internet (port forwarding etc) to be enabled. This does not expose your RMM server to the internet in any way. I forgot my username to login to the web UI, how can I find it? \u00b6 Do the following as the tactical user which will list all user accounts: tactical@trmm:~$ /rmm/api/env/bin/python /rmm/api/tacticalrmm/manage.py shell Python 3 .11.3 ( main, Apr 9 2023 , 04 :41:05 ) [ GCC 10 .2.1 20210110 ] on linux Type \"help\" , \"copyright\" , \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information. ( InteractiveConsole ) >>> from accounts.models import User >>> User.objects.exclude ( is_installer_user = True ) .filter ( agent__isnull = True ) How do I make another superuser for logging into rmm. \u00b6 cd /rmm/api/tacticalrmm/ source ../env/bin/activate python manage.py createsuperuser I am locked out of the web UI. How do I reset my password? \u00b6 SSH into your server and run: /rmm/api/env/bin/python /rmm/api/tacticalrmm/manage.py reset_password <username> How do I reset password or 2 factor token? \u00b6 From TRMM Admin GUI \u00b6 From the web UI, click Settings > User Administration and then right-click on a user: From SSH \u00b6 Login with SSH using your install ID (eg tactical ) and Reset Password OR Reset 2FA token for a TRMM user standard docker /rmm/api/env/bin/python /rmm/api/tacticalrmm/manage.py reset_2fa <username> docker exec -it trmm-backend /bin/bash Then simply log out of the web UI and next time the user logs in they will be redirected to the 2FA setup page which will present a barcode to be scanned with the Authenticator app. How do I recover my MeshCentral login credentials? \u00b6 From Tactical's web UI: Settings > Global Settings > MeshCentral Copy the username, then ssh into the server and run: cd /meshcentral/ sudo systemctl stop meshcentral.service node node_modules/meshcentral --resetaccount <username> --pass <newpassword> sudo systemctl start meshcentral.service to reset Mesh password for user. Warning Resetting the default admin in mesh will break agent installs if you don't also update the mesh connection into in Settings > General > Meshcentral and make sure it's working DNS can't find record \u00b6 Q. My DNS isn\u2019t working. A. Make sure it\u2019s correctly formatted, as most DNS providers add in the domain automatically. License FAQ \u00b6 If you're not certain if your business use case is allowed by the license please open a ticket and let us know how you're planning on using it. Can I password protect the uninstalling of the TRMM agent? \u00b6 From the client / agent side: Installing and uninstalling software is part of system administration. Administrators can install / uninstall. Users cannot. Configure your system appropriately. From the TRMM Admin panel: Use Permissions Manager to restrict your techs permissions. To hide Tactical RMM from the Control Panel's Program and Features, use the following PowerShell command: Set-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall\\{0D34D278-5FAF-4159-A4A0-4E2D2C08139D}_is1' -Name 'SystemComponent' -Value 1 -Type DWord To undo the changes and make Tactical RMM visible again in the Control Panel, use the following PowerShell command: Remove-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall\\{0D34D278-5FAF-4159-A4A0-4E2D2C08139D}_is1' -Name 'SystemComponent' Alternative: Check out some scripts I want to move and/or migrate my server? How do I do it? \u00b6 Changing a public IP or private LAN IP address? \u00b6 TRMM doesn't care about that. TRMM uses DNS, and only the 3 configured DNS names used during install. Make them right, and you'll be fine (with a backup/restore script if necessary) Are you keeping the same DNS names? \u00b6 Use the backup and restore process. Note It's best practice to make sure you're running the latest version before running the backup script, and make sure you have the latest backup script. It does change. Are you wanting to change the DNS names on the server? \u00b6 We warned you you should choose the right DNS names during install. There is no supported way to do this because of the complexities involved. We do offer a paid migration service, please open a ticket for pricing. If you want to try it yourself, your best bet is to use another service outside of TRMM to uninstall and reinstall your agents to a new TRMM server. Then you'll need to migrate all your automation policies, alert policies, patch policies, custom scripts, reports, users, user permissions, user settings, custom fields, api keys, key store items, email configuration, sms configuration etc from your old TRMM server to the new one manually. If you received this link \u00b6 You have asked for assistance in Discord or Github, and you have not provided enough information . Please provide the following information by submitting this , or copy/pasting this text and answering the questions: Install type (Standard/Docker) and amount of RAM on server? Did you deviate IN ANY WAY from these Standard server install instructions https://docs.tacticalrmm.com/install_server/ ? Did you deviate IN ANY WAY from these Docker server install instructions https://docs.tacticalrmm.com/install_docker/ ? Where is the server (VPS/onprem)? New/old install? Rough age of TRMM server (days/weeks/months)? Server Install Specific questions: What OS/version is TRMM installed on. Using a real domain? Did letsencrypt finalize and work? Have you looked at the troubleshooting steps to see if something there is appropriate to you situation? Test DNS from an agent etc. https://docs.tacticalrmm.com/troubleshooting/ Run the Server Troubleshooting Script and DM the person (from @Support) that is working with you https://docs.tacticalrmm.com/troubleshooting/#server-troubleshooting-script What kind of ssl certs? Let's Encrypt, or purchased. Check Expiry date of your certificates in the browser (at https://rmm.example.com/ ) Network Troubleshooting Are you using a proxy? Are you a wizard? See https://docs.tacticalrmm.com/unsupported_guidelines/ If so, what's in the network between agent and server? Agent Troubleshooting Is there ANY 3rd party Antivirus installed on the computer? Is there any network based filtering/AV filtering? Asking yourself questions like: When did it go from working to broken? What changed during that time? This will help you. We can not help you until we understand your setup. Just posting an error log is not enough information. You can help yourself by running this and this that will test your server and and tell you common problems. If you would like us to do it for you please contact support . Should I use a Check or a Task? \u00b6 Checks Run every 2-1440 mins (1 day max) Results are naturally graphed, and not logged to the agents \"History\" tab Tasks Is run using the Windows Task Scheduler on the agent. Although multiple times/day can be scheduled it's complicated and will clutter up your \"History\" tab. Best for periodic script runs that run daily/weekly/monthly/onboarding/once Is Tactical RMM vulnerable to Log4j \u00b6 No. Terminology \u00b6 Code Signing: A windows .exe cryptographic signing process that can't be forged. The only want to reliably whitelist your TRMM agent is to have a Code signed agent that you can give the signers public key to your security software to whitelist. Mac/Linux Pre-Compiled binaries: Are provided by Amidaware so you can install agents on Mac and Linux. This requires sponsorship .

Everything that is queued, happens immediately when agents are online. The agent gets a NATS command, the server tells it to do xyz and it does it. When agents are not connected to the server nothing happens. The Windows Task Scheduler says do x at some time, what it's asked to do is get x command from the server. If the server is offline, nothing happens. If an agent comes online, every x interval (Windows Update, pending tasks etc) check and see if there is something for me to do that I missed while I was offline. When that time occurs (eg agent sees if it needs to update itself at 35 minutes past every hour Update Agents ) it'll get requested on the online agent.

When scripts / checks execute, they are: Transferred from the server via NATS. Saved to a randomly created file in C:\\ProgramData\\TacticalRMM . Executed. Return info is captured and returned to the server via NATS. File in C:\\ProgramData\\TacticalRMM is removed automatically after execution / timeout. Command Parameters for scripts stay in memory Also \"Send Command\" stay in memory as well. Having said that...Windows logs all things PowerShell: Event Viewer > Microsoft > Windows > PowerShell > Operational Log so be careful with fancy API calls and auth token using agents for execution. Warning Remember: Auth tokens are Username/Password/2FA verification all rolled into a single chunk of text! RunAsUser functionality \u00b6 Now that we know the agent runs under the SYSTEM security context and what that means, there is an option to \"RunAsUser\" (Windows only). There are multiple things to understand and consider. TRMMs native \"RunAsUser\" is only supported on workstations and non-RDP/terminal services servers. The user has to be logged in, if the computer is still sitting at the Login screen there will be no active user to discover, and fail. If you're using fast user switching, it is the active user that will be discovered and used. There are two ways to do RunAsUser with tactical in relation to scripting. The Tactical RMM \"RunAsUser\" checkbox associated with the script, and all code will be run under the actively logged in user only with their security permissions. The user access token that will be used is the limited user access token . You will not be able to do any admin level stuff because TRMM's RunAsUser doesn't have a UAC elevation capability to call and request a 2nd access token with admin privileges. Using the PowerShell \"RunAsUser\" 3rd party module Outbound Firewall Rules \u00b6 If you have strict firewall rules these are the only outbound rules from the agent needed for all functionality: All agents have to be able to connect outbound to TRMM server on the 3 domain names on port 443. The agent uses https://icanhazip.tacticalrmm.io/ to get public IP info. If this site is down for whatever reason, the agent will fallback to https://icanhazip.com and then https://ifconfig.co/ip Unsigned Agents \u00b6 Unsigned agents require access to: https://github.com/amidaware/rmmagent/releases/* for downloading / updating agents. Signed Agents \u00b6 Signed agents require access to: https://agents.tacticalrmm.com for downloading / updating agents. Agent Installation Process \u00b6 Copies temp files to C:\\ProgramData\\TacticalRMM folder. INNO setup installs app into %ProgramFiles%\\TacticalAgent\\ folder.

Windows Update Management \u00b6 The current Tactical RMM Windows Update process is relatively simple atm. As of right now, it is in the top 3 big items to be reworked. TLDR: Tactical RMM Based Patching Recommendation \u00b6 Use the Automation Policy > Patch Policy to apply it to machines. The Other category is poorly named by Microsoft, those are the regular monthly updates and should be auto-approved. Be patient, and things will be patched (based on the policy). Trying to immediately approve patches to many machines OR block specific patches is a slow and manual process. Note If you want more control of Windows patching right now, look into a script-based implementation of PSWindowsUpdate . Be aware : When you install the Tactical RMM Agent on a Windows computer it sets this: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\WindowsUpdate\\AU AUOptions (REG_DWORD): 1: Keep my computer up to date is disabled in Automatic Updates. If you want to resume normal Windows patching and disable Tactical RMM updating functions, you should run this . Where does it get updates from? TRMM gets the list of Windows updates using this Microsoft API: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/_wua/ The Tactical RMM server updates an agent's patch list every 8 hours based on the patch policy to check for what to update, and what's installed. Note Currently if the agent is not online at the time the patch policy is set to install, there is no \"install as soon as it comes online\". Tip Trying to get reboots to happen at specific times after Windows update? Set your Reboot After Installation to: Never Then create a task that reboots at your preferred date/time Log Files \u00b6 You can find 3 sets of detailed logs at /rmm/api/tacticalrmm/tacticalrmm/private/log . error.log Nginx log for all errors on all TRMM URL's: rmm, api and mesh tail -f /rmm/api/tacticalrmm/tacticalrmm/private/log/error.log access.log Nginx log for auditing access on all URL's: rmm, api and mesh ( this is a large file, and should be cleaned periodically ) tail -f /rmm/api/tacticalrmm/tacticalrmm/private/log/access.log django_debug.log created by Django webapp tail -f /rmm/api/tacticalrmm/tacticalrmm/private/log/django_debug.log Failed / Successful Admin logins \u00b6 These are logged in /rmm/api/tacticalrmm/tacticalrmm/private/log/access.log Successful Login 10.0.0.18 - - [21/May/2025:00:01:43 -0400] \"POST /v2/checkcreds/ HTTP/1.1\" 200 13 \"https://rmm.example.com/\" \"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/136.0.0.0 Safari/537.36\" Failed Login 10.0.8.62 - - [21/May/2025:00:01:13 -0400] \"POST /v2/checkcreds/ HTTP/1.1\" 400 17 \"https://rmm.example.com/\" \"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/136.0.0.0 Safari/537.36\" Field Description 10.0.0.18 Client IP address - Unused (RFC 1413 identity) - Unused (authenticated user ID) [21/May/2025:00:01:43 -0400] Timestamp (local time with timezone offset) \"POST /v2/checkcreds/ HTTP/1.1\" HTTP request method, path, and version 200 HTTP status code (200 = OK/success) (400 = Failed) 13 Response size in bytes (body only) \"https://rmm.example.com/\" Referer URL (origin of the request) \"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0;...)

If the server is offline, nothing happens. If an agent comes online, every x interval (Windows Update, pending tasks etc) check and see if there is something for me to do that I missed while I was offline.

All it does is download the Inno Setup installer and call it using predefined command line args that you choose from the web UI. It \"bakes\" the command line args into the executable. Please note that using this method can result in this . PowerShell \u00b6 The PowerShell method is also a wrapper around the Manual install method and functionally identical to the dynamically generated EXE installer but in powershell format instead of EXE format. Tip You can reuse the installer for any of the deployment methods, you don't need to constantly create a new installer for each new agent. The installer will be valid for however long you specify the token expiry time when generating an agent. Using a Deployment Link \u00b6 The main benefit of this method is that the executable is generated only whenever the deployment download link is accessed, whereas with the other methods it's generated right away and the agent's version is hardcoded into the exe. Using a deployment link will allow you to not worry about installing using an older version of an agent, which will fail to install if you have updated your RMM to a version that is not compatible with an older installer you might have lying around. The deployment link method uses the dynamic EXE method behind the scenes. To create a deployment, from the web UI click Agents > Manage Deployments . Tip Create a client / site named \"Default\" and create a deployment for it with a very long expiry to have a generic installer that can be deployed anytime at any client / site. You can then move the agent into the correct client / site from the web UI after it's been installed. Copy / paste the download link from the deployment into your browser. It will take a few seconds to dynamically generate the executable and then your browser will automatically download the exe. Optional Installer Args \u00b6 The following optional arguments can be passed to any of the installation method executables: --log debug Will print very verbose logging during agent install. Useful for troubleshooting agent install. --silent This will not popup any message boxes during install, including any error messages or the \"Installation was successful\" message box that pops up at the end of a successful install. --proxy \"http://proxyserver:port\" Use a http proxy. --meshdir \"C:\\Program Files\\Your Company Name\\Mesh Agent\" Specify the full path to the directory containing MeshAgent.exe if using custom agent branding for your MeshCentral instance. --nomesh Do not install MeshCentral agent during Tactical agent install. Note: Take Control, Remote Terminal and File Browser will not work. You can get full command line options from ( --help ). Scripting Agent Installation \u00b6 If you want to deploy the TRMM agent using AD, Intune, Mesh, TeamViewer, Group Policy GPO, etc, this is a sample CMD script for deploying Tactical. Install Scripts batch file powershell msi Note You will need to replace deployment url with your custom deployment URL: @ echo off REM Setup deployment URL set \"DeploymentURL=\" set \"Name=\" for /f \"usebackq tokens=* delims=\" %% # in ( `wmic service where \"name like 'tacticalrmm'\" get Name /Format:Value` ) do ( for /f \"tokens=* delims=\" %% g in ( \" %% #\" ) do set \"%%g\" ) if not defined Name ( echo Tactical RMM not found, installing now. if not exist c:\\ProgramData\\TacticalRMM\\temp md c:\\ProgramData\\TacticalRMM\\temp powershell Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted powershell Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath \"C:\\Program Files\\TacticalAgent\\*\" powershell Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath \"C:\\Program Files\\Mesh Agent\\*\" powershell Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath C:\\ProgramData\\TacticalRMM\\* cd c:\\ProgramData\\TacticalRMM\\temp powershell Invoke-WebRequest \" %DeploymentURL% \" -Outfile tactical.exe REM \"C:\\Program Files\\TacticalAgent\\unins000.exe\" /VERYSILENT tactical.exe rem exit /b 1 ) else ( echo Tactical RMM already installed Exiting Exit 0 ) # Update variables $deploymenturl = \"<deployment URL>\" $agentstoinstall = 1 # Replace with the number of agents to install if greater than 20 # Do not modify below here $randomSleepTime = if ( $agentstoinstall -gt 1 ) { Get-Random -Minimum 1 -Maximum (( $agentstoinstall + 1 ) * 2 ) } else { 1 } Start-Sleep -Seconds $randomSleepTime Invoke-WebRequest $deploymenturl -OutFile ( New-Item -Path \"c:\\ProgramData\\TacticalRMM\\temp\\trmminstall.exe\" -Force ) $proc = Start-Process \"c:\\ProgramData\\TacticalRMM\\temp\\trmminstall.exe\" -ArgumentList '-silent' -PassThru Wait-Process -InputObject $proc if ( $proc .

Create the msi Apply via GPO software deployment to the appropriate machines Script for Full Agent Uninstall \u00b6 You can always use this to silently uninstall the agent on workstations: Choose your method: Windows Automatically Mac linux \"C:\\Program Files\\TacticalAgent\\unins000.exe\" /VERYSILENT Run: https://github.com/amidaware/tacticalrmm/blob/develop/api/tacticalrmm/core/mac_uninstall.sh Download: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amidaware/tacticalrmm/develop/api/tacticalrmm/core/agent_linux.sh Run: ./agent_linux.sh uninstall Reinstalling Mesh and Reconnecting to TRMM \u00b6 Run this from Send Command : \"C:\\Program Files\\Mesh Agent\\meshagent.exe\" -fullinstall Then use Agent Recovery > Mesh Agent , and choose Recover : Stuck at \"Downloading mesh agent...\"? \u00b6 Make sure TRMM can connect to Mesh. Run: /rmm/api/env/bin/python /rmm/api/tacticalrmm/manage.py check_mesh If there's an error, make sure you have it setup correctly . Install Linux Agent (beta) \u00b6 To install: 1. Go to rmm.yourdomain.com and login. 2. Click on Agents > Install Agent. 3. Choose the Client, Site, Server or Workstation and Architecture (change expiry if required) as well as Linux. 4. Click Download. 5. If downloaded on the Linux machine you want to add as an agent (otherwise copy to machine using WinSCP or similar) open terminal. 6. cd to the folder you have downloaded the script to. 7. Run chmod +x rmm-clientname-sitename-type.sh 8. Run sudo ./rmm-clientname-sitename-type.sh and wait for script to complete. If you changed the expiry time you could upload the script to any accessible server and deploy to multiple devices. -- debug Will print very verbose logging during agent install. Useful for troubleshooting agent install. Linux Deployment Link \u00b6 Currently there are no deploy links for Linux agents however you could use the following method if uploaded somewhere (website etc). An example deployment script would be (note there's an install token in that script, so delete it when done if you're concerned): wget scripturl chmod +x rmm.sh ./rmm.sh Mac Agent Permissions \u00b6 macOS 15+ Sequoia macOS 14 Sonoma and earlier Enable Screen Sharing under settings.

Get in touch to find out what we can do for you! System Requirements \u00b6 A fresh Linux VM running either Debian 11, Debian 12 or Ubuntu 22.04 LTS with at least 4GB RAM on x64 or aarch64 (arm64) architecture. Warning The provided install script assumes a fresh server with no software installed on it. Attempting to run it on an existing server with other services will break things and the install will fail. Danger The installation script configures a production-grade reverse proxy using Nginx, which manages TLS termination and appropriately routes all requests to the correct backends. Consequently, there's no need for an additional proxy in front of your instance, as it will lead to complications. If you opt to use another reverse proxy (e.g., NPM, HAproxy) in conjunction with the existing Nginx reverse proxy (which is essential for TRMM to function correctly) you must address potential challenges arising from double proxying, and you should NOT expect your install to function properly out of the box. Be advised, configurations involving a secondary reverse proxy will be considered \"unsupported.\" This designation is not to deter modifications but stems from the development team's capacity constraints. Their primary focus remains on enhancing the core software, and they cannot support an endless variety of setups. Check unsupported proxies and unsupported guidelines for more info. Note The install script has been tested on the following public cloud providers: Oracle Cloud Free Tier (arm64), DigitalOcean, Linode, Vultr, Hetzner (highly recommended), AWS, Google Cloud and Azure, as well as behind NAT on Hyper-V, ESXi and Proxmox (CT's on Proxmox are unsupported , only use VMs). Note CPU: 1 core is fine for < 200 agents with limited checks/tasks. Disk space and speed are dependent on your use case. Of course faster is better SSD/NVMe. Space is dependent on how long you're keeping historical data, how many checks/script runs and their output size. 50GB should be fine for < 12months of history on < 200 agents with < 30 checks/tasks run at reasonable time intervals. Tip Enable logging of your terminal output. A good Windows SSH client is MobaXTerm . It'll automatically log everything so if you need it later (like install logs because you have a 50x error trying to login after) they'll be easy to grab and share with support. It has an integrated SCP client too! Install Requirements \u00b6 A TOTP based authenticator app. Some popular ones are Google Authenticator, Authy, and Microsoft Authenticator. Warning Per RFC 1304 special chars in domain names are not allowed (like _ ). Only a-z 0-9 and the hyphen (-) Avoid sub-sub domains greater than 4. (Best: rmm.example.com Good: rmm.corp.example.com Bad: rmm.corp.xyz.example.com) Country TLDs like co.uk count as one layer. Option 1: Easy Install on a VPS \u00b6 Install on a VPS: DigitalOcean, Linode, Vultr, Hetzner (highly recommended), AWS, Google Cloud and Azure to name a few. Step 1 - Run Updates on OS \u00b6 SSH into the server as root . Install the pre-reqs and apply the latest updates: apt update apt install -y wget curl sudo ufw apt -y upgrade If a new kernel is installed, reboot the server with the reboot command. Step 2 - Create a User \u00b6 Create a user named tactical to run the RMM and add it to the sudoers group. useradd -m -G sudo -s /bin/bash tactical passwd tactical Step 3 - Setup the firewall (optional but highly recommended) \u00b6 Info Skip this step if your VM is not publicly exposed to the world e.g. running behind NAT. You should setup the firewall rules in your router instead. Port 443 TCP: For agents and tech login to rmm and mesh. Port 22 TCP: For SSH, server administration only ufw default deny incoming ufw default allow outgoing ufw allow https Info SSH (port 22 TCP) is only required for you to remotely login and do basic server administration for your RMM. It is not needed for any agent communication. SSH Firewall Rule Restrict SSH Allow all SSH Allow SSH from only allowed IP's ( highly recommended) ufw allow proto tcp from X.X.X.X to any port 22 ufw allow proto tcp from X.X.X.X to any port 22 Allow SSH from everywhere ( not recommended) ufw allow ssh Enable and activate the firewall: ufw enable && ufw reload Note You should/will never login to the server as root again unless something has gone horribly wrong, and you're working with the developers. Step 4 - Create DNS A records \u00b6 Warning All 3 domain names MUST be at the same subdomain level because you only get one LetsEncrypt wildcard cert, and it'll only apply to that level of DNS name. We'll be using example.com as our domain for this example. Info The RMM uses 3 different sites. The Vue frontend e.g. rmm.example.com which is where you'll be accessing your RMM from the browser, the REST backend e.g. api.example.com and MeshCentral e.g. mesh.example.com rmm. api. and mesh. are what we recommend, but you can use whatever you want if they're already in use. Get the public IP of your server with curl https://icanhazip.tacticalrmm.io Open the DNS manager of wherever the domain you purchased is hosted. Create 3 A records: rmm , api and mesh and point them to the public IP of your server: Step 5 - Run the install script \u00b6 Switch to the tactical user: su - tactical Tip If you can snapshot do that now so you can quickly restore to this point again and re-run the install in case something goes wrong with the install script. Download and run the install script: wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amidaware/tacticalrmm/master/install.sh chmod +x install.sh ./install.sh Info Already have your own SSL certificate? Call the install script with the --use-own-cert flag, like this: ./install.sh --use-own-cert Ensure your cert and private key exist on the server as the install script will prompt you for the locations of these 2 files. Also ensure that it is a legitimate, trusted certificate and includes the full chain for proper validation. Do not use this option with self-signed certs. Danger You can install with the --insecure switch to use any DNS name you want. Self signed certs will be generated for all the DNS names, and all SSL certificate chain validation will be disabled in TRMM. ./install.sh --insecure Requirements : You MUST open all 3 subdomains in your web browser and accept the security warning for each site BEFORE LOGIN or you will get \"Backend is offline (network error)\" errors. \u2705 Quick install for easy test driving \u2705 No public DNS name needed. Use irulez.local or any DNS name you want. \u2705 No cert renewals \u274c All agent communication is vulnerable to MITM compromise and can be hacked. \u274c You can't convert from an --insecure to trusted cert install without reinstalling all your agents \u274c Can't use Agent install Deployment links. Manual installation method only \u274c Restore does not work Answer the initial questions when prompted. Replace example.com with your domain. Step 6 - Deploy the TXT record in your DNS manager for Let's Encrypt wildcard certs \u00b6 Skip this step if using your own certs or using self-signed certs. Warning TXT records can take anywhere from 1 minute to a few hours to propagate depending on your DNS provider. You should verify the TXT record has been deployed first before pressing Enter. A quick way to check is with the following command: dig -t txt _acme-challenge.example.com (not from the TRMM server) or test using: https://viewdns.info/dnsrecord/ Enter: _acme-challenge.example.com Create a login for the RMM web UI: A bunch of URLS / usernames / passwords will be printed out at the end of the install script. Save these somewhere safe. Recover them if you didn't Step 7 - Login \u00b6 Navigate to https://rmm.example.com and login with the username/password you created during install. Once logged in, you will be redirected to the initial setup page. Create your first client/site and choose the default timezone. You're Done Update Regularly Option 2: Install Behind NAT Router \u00b6 Install in your local network using: Dedicated hardware, Hyper-V, Proxmox or ESXi. All been tested and work fine. Do everything from Option 1: Easy Install If You Only Have Agents on the Private Network / Subnet \u00b6 Make sure your local DNS server (or agents hosts file) have your Tactical RMM server IP addresses for the 3 domain names: rmm , api and mesh Agents Exist Outside the Private Network / Subnet - Setup Port Forwarding \u00b6 If you have agents outside your local network: Make sure the public DNS servers have A records for the 3 Tactical RMM server domain names: rmm , api and mesh Login to your router / NAT device. Set your TRMM server as a static IP (Using a DHCP reservation is usually safer). Port forward TCP 443 to your TRMM servers private IP address. Note https://portforward.com/ can help with Port Forwarding setup You're Done Update Regularly Option 3: Installs by Network Wizards \u00b6 Use the scripts above. Requirements \u00b6 TLD domain name which is internet resolvable (this is for a LetsEncrypt DNS wildcard request during the install script validated by DNS txt record ). Test using: https://viewdns.info/dnsrecord/ or https://dnschecker.org/ . Enter: _acme-challenge.example.com as TXT Agents need to be able to connect to your server via DNS lookup (hosts file, local DNS, smoke signals etc.). Test from agent: ping rmm.example.com .

Real time shell. Real time file browser. Note MeshCentral has issues with Firefox, use a Chromium-based browser. It should be noted that Tactical RMM and MeshCentral are 2 completely separate products and can run independently of each other. They do not even have to run on the same box, however when you install Tactical RMM it simply installs MeshCentral for you with some pre-configured settings to allow integration. It is highly recommended to use the MeshCentral instance that Tactical installs, since it allows the developers more control over it and to ensure things don't break. How does it work? \u00b6 Please watch this video to fully understand how mesh integrations and permissions sync work. MeshCentral has an embedding feature that allows integration into existing products. See Section 14 - Embedding MeshCentral in the MeshCentral User Guide for a detailed explanation of how this works. The Tactical RMM agent keeps track of your Mesh agents, and periodically interacts with them to synchronize the Mesh agent's unique ID with the Tactical RMM database. When you do a take control / terminal / file browser on an agent using the Tactical UI, behind the scenes, Tactical generates a login token for MeshCentral's website and then \"wraps\" MeshCentral's UI in an iframe for that specific agent only, using it's unique ID to know what agent to render in the iframe. Customize Take Control Username \u00b6 If you've enabled any of the remote control options such as \"Notify user\", \"Prompt for consent\" and \"Show connection toolbar\" and you'd like to change the name that users see, make sure the user has a First and/or Last name set TRMM (Settings > User Administration). If you would also like your company name to show, you can set your company name in TRMM > Settings > Global Settings > MeshCentral. Turn off the sync feature \u00b6 If you're having issues with the new MeshCentral sync feature added in TRMM v0.18.0 you can simply disable it to revert back to the previous behavior prior to this release, although you're probably just looking for way to get the old mesh interface back : From TRMM's web interface go to Settings > Global Settings > MeshCentral Un-check the \"Sync Mesh Perms with TRMM\" checkbox, and click Yes to the \"are you sure\" prompt. Click \"Save\" Toggle a full permissions re-sync \u00b6 From TRMM's web interface go to Settings > Global Settings > MeshCentral Un-check the \"Sync Mesh Perms with TRMM\" checkbox, and click Yes to the \"are you sure\" prompt. Click \"Save\" Re-open the same settings window and check the same checkbox, click yes to the prompt, and Save. Wait a few minutes for the sync to fully complete in the background. Video Get a url to login to mesh as the mesh superuser \u00b6 This will generate a url that will log you into meshcentral as the superuser, the same way it used to be prior to TRMM Release 0.18.0 You should open this in a different browser than the one you're using for TRMM, or open in an incognito window. /rmm/api/env/bin/python /rmm/api/tacticalrmm/manage.py get_mesh_login_url Modifying the Internal Mesh Port Configuration \u00b6 By default, Tactical RMM configures the Mesh service to listen on the internal port 4430. Should there be a need to modify this default port within the Nginx or Mesh configuration, it is imperative to update Tactical RMM with the new port information. To accomplish this, the following entry must be added to the file /rmm/api/tacticalrmm/tacticalrmm/local_settings.py : MESH_PORT = < new_port_number > Replace <new_port_number> with the actual port number you have configured. For example, if the new port number is 1234, the entry should be as follows: MESH_PORT = 1234 Then, restart your entire server for changes to take effect. Running your own existing or separate MeshCentral server? \u00b6 We do testing to make sure everything works with the version found here (look for MESH_VER). Installation instructions for using your own MeshCentral server: Run standard installation. After installation is complete, disable meshcentral sudo systemctl disable --now meshcentral . In TRMM Web UI go to Settings > Global Settings > MeshCentral and update values from your existing mesh (make sure to use a mesh superuser). Username MUST be all lowercase. Mesh Token find with this Add USE_EXTERNAL_MESH = True to /rmm/api/tacticalrmm/tacticalrmm/local_settings.py Restart TRMM server. Info Mesh usernames are CaSe sEnSiTive Take Control Connect vs RDP Connect \u00b6 When using Take Control from Tactical RMM you are using the Desktop function in MeshCentral Connect button: Right-click the button for options. About the same a VNC, but it's not compatible with VNC. The original VNC protocol did not use JPEG, instead it uses RLE encoding or ZRLE. MeshCentral's remote desktop only uses JPEG (or WEBP in some cases) because browsers can decode JPEG easily. The MeshAgent will split the desktop into 32x32 pixel tiles and see if any of the tiles have changed. If a group of tiles change since the last frame, a JPEG is sent to update the area. RDP Connect button: Is a browser based RDP client. It connects to the native RDP in versions of Windows that support inbound RDP connects. Pro, Workstation, Enterprise, Server, Terminal Server, RDS Server etc. You must enable RDP in Windows to be able to connect to it, it's not enabled by default (or enable when installing agent if supported). Note It does not work for Windows Home because Home doesn't support incoming RDP connections. Remote Terminal how it works \u00b6 For the remote terminal, we launch a shell on the remote system and pipe VT100 terminal emulation to/from the browser. On the browser, we use XTermJS to view the terminal session. MeshCentral Options \u00b6 There are MANY MeshCentral options that you can configure. Here are some you might want to investigate: allowHighQualityDesktop desktopMultiplex userAllowedIP agentAllowedIP tlsOffload (for proxy users) maxInvalid2fa Using Tactical RMM Without MeshCentral \u00b6 Install Tactical RMM normally. Then, to disable the MeshCentral Server on the TRMM server run: sudo systemctl disable --now meshcentral mongod Then when installing an agent, make sure to pass the -nomesh flag to the installer Fixing missing agents in TRMM or Mesh \u00b6 Fixing Missing agent Agent Missing in Mesh Agent Missing in TRMM From the Script Library run: TacticalRMM - Install Mesh Agent if it's not installed Then from trmm web ui right click agent > agent recovery > mesh agent Use mesh to run the trmm agent installer with the --nomesh flag. Then from trmm web ui right click agent > agent recovery > mesh agent OMG MeshCentral isn't maintained anymore! \u00b6 MeshCentral is still actively being maintained , the lead devs had jobs in which they were paid by a corporation to develop MeshCentral, they now have got other jobs which means they are supporting and developing MeshCentral in their free time (like alot of other projects) this means development is slower but not that it isn't maintained anymore. If this changes or it becomes necessary to fix something that breaks or packages needing updated we are prepared to begin maintaining our own fork. The features of MeshCentral that TRMM uses are only the 3 items above and are extremely mature.","title":"MeshCentral Integration"},{"location":"mesh_integration/#meshcentral-integration","text":"","title":"MeshCentral Integration"},{"location":"mesh_integration/#overview","text":"Tactical RMM integrates with MeshCentral for the following 3 functions: Take Control.

If the purpose of your restore is to migrate your instance from one machine to another e.g. to upgrade your install to a newer OS and/or different arch, then it is recommended to leave both the old and new instances up and running until all your agents have successfully migrated to the new instance. You can use the old instance to forcefully migrate stubborn agents that are still attached to it (see instructions below). Setup the new server \u00b6 Follow the same instructions as a fresh install but stop when you reach the 'Run the install script' section (you'll be using the restore script instead of install). Tip Take a snapshot of your vm if possible so you can get back to this point if something doesn't work right and you have to try the restore again.

Before applying these settings in production, use a pre-production environment so potential disruptions in your own environment and the service that you provide to your clients can be avoided. Warning Use the contents included in this guide and apply the security settings detailed here at your own discretion. Info Please check the following github issue for potential side effects of deploying these configs. Intro \u00b6 This section is structured in three main subsections: Enabling GeoIP in NGINX config with the purpose of filtering (blocking) web requests based on the country\u2019s source IP. Enabling anti \u201cbad\u201d bots/referrers in HTTP requests to the NGINX server. Compiling and enabling ModSec + OWASP CRS in NGINX server. Each section can be enabled independently. Hardening NGINX settings \u00b6 GeoIP Integration in NGINX - Blocking Requests by Country Code \u00b6 Install required packages and NGINX module for GeoIP: # apt-get install geoip-database libgeoip1 libnginx-mod-http-geoip Verify that the GeoIP database files have been placed in the right location: # ls -lrt /usr/share/GeoIP/ total 10004 -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 8138841 Jan 24 2020 GeoIPv6.dat -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 2099217 Jan 24 2020 GeoIP.dat Edit NGINX config file ( /etc/nginx/nginx.conf ) and add the following config under the http { block: http { ## # Basic Settings ## # Load GeoIP Database geoip_country /usr/share/GeoIP/GeoIP.dat; } The next settings will depend on the desired GeoIP blocking strategy. For \u201callow by default, deny by exception\u201d, the config would be: http { ## # Basic Settings ## # Load GeoIP Database geoip_country /usr/share/GeoIP/GeoIP.dat; # map the list of denied countries map $geoip_country_code $allowed_country { default yes; # BLOCKED_COUNTRY_1 COUNTRY_CODE_1 no; # BLOCKED_COUNTRY_2 COUNTRY_CODE_2 no; # BLOCKED_COUNTRY_3 COUNTRY_CODE_3 no; } } (The macro can be modified to achieve the \u201cdeny by default, allow by exception\u201d approach). Finally, the following \u201cif\u201d statement needs to be placed in all the vhosts where the GeoIP blocking should take effect, under the \u201clocation\u201d section: location / { root /var/www/rmm/dist; try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html; add_header Cache-Control \"no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate\"; add_header Pragma \"no-cache\"; # block the country if ($allowed_country = no) { return 444; } } The HTTP Status = 444 is a good choice for NGINX not \u201cwasting\u201d too many resources in sending back the 4xx code to the client being blocked by GeoIP.

Finally, edit every vhost file (\u201c/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/frontend.conf\u201d, \u201c/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/rmm.conf\u201d and \u201c/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/meshcentral.conf\u201d) and place the following include statements under the \u201cserver\u201d block: server { listen 443 ssl; include /etc/nginx/bots.d/ddos.conf; include /etc/nginx/bots.d/blockbots.conf; } Enabling ModSec in NGINX \u00b6 All steps in this section taken from the NGINX blog post \u201cCompiling and Installing ModSecurity for NGINX Open Source\u201d: https://www.nginx.com/blog/compiling-and-installing-modsecurity-for-open-source-nginx/ Install Prerequisite Packages \u00b6 The first step is to install the packages required to complete the remaining steps in this tutorial. Run the following command, which is appropriate for a freshly installed Ubuntu/Debian system. The required packages might be different for RHEL/CentOS/Oracle Linux. apt-get install -y apt-utils autoconf automake build-essential git libcurl4-openssl-dev libgeoip-dev liblmdb-dev libpcre++-dev libtool libxml2-dev libyajl-dev pkgconf wget zlib1g-dev Download and Compile the ModSecurity 3.0 Source Code \u00b6 With the required prerequisite packages installed, the next step is to compile ModSecurity as an NGINX dynamic module. In ModSecurity 3.0\u2019s new modular architecture, libmodsecurity is the core component which includes all rules and functionality. The second main component in the architecture is a connector that links libmodsecurity to the web server it is running with. There are separate connectors for NGINX, Apache HTTP Server, and IIS. We cover the NGINX connector in the next section. To compile libmodsecurity: Clone the GitHub repository: git clone --depth 1 -b v3/master --single-branch https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity Change to the ModSecurity directory and compile the source code: cd ModSecurity git submodule init git submodule update ./build.sh ./configure make make install cd .. The compilation takes about 15 minutes, depending on the processing power of your system. Note: It\u2019s safe to ignore messages like the following during the build process. Even when they appear, the compilation completes and creates a working object. fatal: No names found, cannot describe anything. Download the NGINX Connector for ModSecurity and Compile It as a Dynamic Module \u00b6 Compile the ModSecurity connector for NGINX as a dynamic module for NGINX. Clone the GitHub repository: git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity-nginx.git Determine which version of NGINX is running on the host where the ModSecurity module will be loaded: $ nginx -v nginx version: nginx/1.18.0 ( Ubuntu ) Download the source code corresponding to the installed version of NGINX (the complete sources are required even though only the dynamic module is being compiled): wget http://nginx.org/download/nginx-1.18.0.tar.gz tar zxvf nginx-1.18.0.tar.gz Compile the dynamic module and copy it to the standard directory for modules: cd nginx-1.18.0 ./configure --with-compat --add-dynamic-module = ../ModSecurity-nginx make modules cp objs/ngx_http_modsecurity_module.so /etc/nginx/modules cp objs/ngx_http_modsecurity_module.so /usr/share/nginx/modules/ cd .. Load the NGINX ModSecurity Connector Dynamic Module \u00b6 Add the following load_module directive to the main (top\u2011level) context in /etc/nginx/nginx.conf. It instructs NGINX to load the ModSecurity dynamic module when it processes the configuration: load_module modules/ngx_http_modsecurity_module.so; Configure and Enable ModSecurity \u00b6 The final step is to enable and test ModSecurity. Set up the appropriate ModSecurity configuration file. Here we\u2019re using the recommended ModSecurity configuration provided by TrustWave Spiderlabs, the corporate sponsors of ModSecurity. mkdir /etc/nginx/modsec wget -P /etc/nginx/modsec/ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity/v3/master/modsecurity.conf-recommended mv /etc/nginx/modsec/modsecurity.conf-recommended /etc/nginx/modsec/modsecurity.conf To guarantee that ModSecurity can find the unicode.mapping file (distributed in the top\u2011level ModSecurity directory of the GitHub repo), copy it to /etc/nginx/modsec. cp ModSecurity/unicode.mapping /etc/nginx/modsec Change the SecRuleEngine directive in the configuration to change from the default \u201cdetection only\u201d mode to actively dropping malicious traffic. #SecRuleEngine DetectionOnly SecRuleEngine On Enabling OWASP Core Rule Set \u00b6 Clone OWASP CRS: cd /etc/nginx/modsec git clone https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset.git Create CRS setup config file: cp /etc/nginx/modsec/coreruleset/crs-setup.conf.example /etc/nginx/modsec/coreruleset/crs-setup.conf Edit config file and enable a paranoia level of 2 (comment out section below and modify the paranoia level from 1 - default to 2): SecAction \\ \"id:900000,\\ phase:1,\\ nolog,\\ pass,\\ t:none,\\ setvar:tx.paranoia_level=2\" A Paranoia level of 2 is a good combination of security rules to load by the ModSec engine while keeping low the number of false positives. The OWASP CRS team carried out some tests using BURP against ModSec + OWASP CRS: Create ModSecurity base config file (\u201c/etc/nginx/modsec/modsec-base-cfg.conf\u201d) and include the following lines (the order is important) : Include /etc/nginx/modsec/modsecurity.conf Include /etc/nginx/modsec/coreruleset/crs-setup.conf Include /etc/nginx/modsec/coreruleset/rules/*.conf Enable ModSec in all NGINX enabled sites: \u201c/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/frontend.conf\u201d, \u201c/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/rmm.conf\u201d and \u201c/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/meshcentral.conf\u201d: server { modsecurity on; modsecurity_rules_file /etc/nginx/modsec/modsec-base-cfg.conf; } Tactical RMM custom rules: Access to the admin UI (front-end): We apply the \u201cdeny by default, allow by exception\u201d principle, whereby only a set of predefined public IPs should be allowed to access the UI API and MeshCentral: RMM agents and RMM UI (as referrer while an admin session is active) make web calls that get blocked by the OWASP CRS, specifically PUT, POST and PATCH methods. These three methods can be \u201cwhitelisted\u201d when the requested URI matches legitimate requests. Connection to MeshCentral during Tactical agent install.

The changes include: New Endpoint: The URL has changed from /core/status/ to /core/v2/status/ . Authentication Method: Instead of sending the token in the request body, it must now be included in the X-Mon-Token request header. HTTP Method Change: The request type has changed from POST to GET . Enhanced Response Data: The new response includes additional fields such as celery_queue_len , celery_queue_health , nats_std_ping , nats_ws_ping , and mesh_ping . Removed fields: The services_running response no longer includes django , nginx , and postgres because if any of these services were not running, the monitoring endpoint itself would be inaccessible, making their inclusion redundant.

Follow these steps to check and resolve the issue: Navigate to the following directory and activate the virtual environment: cd /rmm/api/tacticalrmm source ../env/bin/activate Download the management command: wget -O /rmm/api/tacticalrmm/core/management/commands/get_celery_queue_length.py 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amidaware/tacticalrmm/refs/heads/develop/api/tacticalrmm/core/management/commands/get_celery_queue_length.py' Check the number of items in the Celery queue: python manage.py get_celery_queue_length If the number of items in the queue is very high (greater than 100), the queue is likely stuck. Purge the Celery queue: celery -A tacticalrmm purge -f Restart Celery and Celery Beat: sudo systemctl restart celery celerybeat After completing these steps, the queue should be cleared, and Celery should resume normal operation.

It will most probably be a CORS error which means you need to check your DNS settings and make sure whatever computer you're trying to access the UI from resolves your 3 subdomains to the correct IP of the server running the RMM (public IP if running in the cloud, or private IP if running behind NAT). If you see an error about SSL or certificate expired, then your Let's Encrypt cert has probably expired and you'll need to renew it. Refer to the Let's Encrypt cert renewal instructions here . Agents not installing or updating \u00b6 The most common problem we've seen of agents not installing or updating is due to Antivirus blocking the updater executable. Windows Defender will 100% of the time block the updater from running unless an exclusion is set. Refer to the Agent Installation instructions for AV exceptions to set and manually doing an agent update with logging to troubleshoot further. Agents will also not automatically update if they are too old. If you have agents that are relatively old, you will need to uninstall them manually and reinstall using the latest version. The mesh installer is created at time of install. Make sure it's working by running this on your TRMM server. Check TRMM connection to MeshCentral Standard Install docker /rmm/api/env/bin/python /rmm/api/tacticalrmm/manage.py check_mesh sudo docker compose exec tactical-backend python manage.py check_mesh Warning As of v0.12.0 Error 1005 usually means something doesn't match and / or the mesh username has to be all lower case. If you customize the \"Mesh Device Group Name\" in Tactical's settings you MUST also manually match that Mesh Group in mesh itself because you must understand .

Fix it till the test above works. Agents not checking in or showing up / General agent issues \u00b6 Eg. Agent Boot time: 53 years ago These are NATS problems. Try the quick fixes first: From Admin Web Interface \u00b6 First, reload NATS from Tactical's web UI: Tools > Server Maintenance > Reload Nats Configuration If that doesn't work, check each part starting with the server: Server SSH login \u00b6 Reload NATS: /rmm/api/env/bin/python /rmm/api/tacticalrmm/manage.py reload_nats sudo systemctl restart nats.service Look at NATS service errors (make sure it's running): sudo systemctl status nats.service If NATS isn't running see detailed reason why it isn't: sudo systemctl stop nats.service nats-server -DVV -c /rmm/api/tacticalrmm/nats-rmm.conf Fix the problem, then restart NATS: sudo systemctl restart nats.service From Agent Install \u00b6 Open CMD as admin on the problem computer and stop the agent services: net stop tacticalrmm Run the tacticalrmm service manually with debug logging: \"C:\\Program Files\\TacticalAgent\\tacticalrmm.exe\" -m rpc -log debug -logto stdout This will print out a ton of info. You should be able to see the error from the debug log output. Please then copy / paste the logs and post them either in our Discord support chat , or create a github issue . If all else fails, simply uninstall the agent either from control panel or silently with \"C:\\Program Files\\TacticalAgent\\unins000.exe\" /VERYSILENT and then reinstall the agent. All other errors \u00b6 First, run the update script with the --force flag. This will fix permissions and reinstall python / node packages that might have gotten corrupted. ./update.sh --force Check the debug log from the web UI: File > Debug Log Open your browser's dev tools ( Ctrl + Shift + J on Chrome) and check the Console tab for any errors. Check all the systemd services that the rmm uses to function and check to make sure they're all active / running and enabled: sudo systemctl status rmm.service sudo systemctl status daphne.service sudo systemctl status celery.service sudo systemctl status celerybeat.service sudo systemctl status nginx.service sudo systemctl status nats.service sudo systemctl status nats-api.service sudo systemctl status meshcentral.service sudo systemctl status mongod.service sudo systemctl status postgresql.service sudo systemctl status redis-server.service Or you can use systemctl --failed to see any failed services on your machine. Read through the log files in the following folders and check for errors: /rmm/api/tacticalrmm/tacticalrmm/private/log /var/log/celery Using Cloudflare DNS \u00b6 rmm.example.com can be proxied. api.example.com can be proxied when using (the default) agent configuration which utilizes websockets. mesh.example.com can NOT be proxied because Cloudflare changed something in Aug 2023 and now it doesn't work. See 5302 . If you're getting Invalid group id at the end of the install you're probably doing something wrong / wrong IP for api. Testing network connectivity between agent and server \u00b6 Using PowerShell, make sure you can connect to 443 from agent to server: Test-NetConnection -ComputerName api . example . com -Port 443 Check your SSL certs to make sure they are what they should be (no proxy stuff): https://www.digicert.com/help/ Are you trying to use a reverse proxy to share your single public IP with multiple services on 443?

Don't use Firefox (test in vanilla Chrome first). Open mesh.domain.com and see if the agent is listed there. If you don't see your agent (or it's offline), restart TRMM server (or service ). Restart Mesh Agent on client PC. Check again. Still not appearing in mesh.domain.com in Mesh go to \"My Server\" > Trace tab > Click tracing button > Check MeshAgent traffic .

Thanks [FWG]SSOO","title":"The Fix"},{"location":"unsupported_proxies/","text":"Unsupported Proxies \u00b6 Note Using Proxies/reverse proxies with Tactical RMM is not a supported configuration, the information below is provided here for your reference. Although these aren't officially supported configurations, we generally will help point you in the right direction. Please use the Discord #unsupported channel to discuss issues related to these complex installations. General Notes on Proxies and Tactical RMM \u00b6 Port 443 \u00b6 Make sure websockets option is enabled. All 3 URL's will need to be configured: rmm , api , mesh For mesh review TLS Offloading . Cloudflare Proxy and Cloudflare Tunnel \u00b6 Youtube Video Showing How Note Between August 2023 and March 2024, MeshCentral would not work properly through CloudFlare proxy/tunnels. Symptoms were Clicking on the \"Connect\" button under \"Desktop\" or \"Terminal\" results in \"Disconnected\" approximately 9/10 times. Something changed on CloudFlare's end. You can still track the GitHub issue about it here . As of 23/03/2024 CloudFlare made some kind of change that fixed it without any acknowledgement. While it has started working again, there are no guarantees that this will continue to work. Use at your own risk. First, just complete a TRMM install like normal- you don't need to put the API, RMM, or Mesh domains into Cloudflare however. You must still follow the TXT record to prove that it's your domain. Once your TRMM install is completed, navigate to CloudFlare Tunnels and create a new Tunnel. Give it any name, Personally, I chose the name TRMM. Now, follow the instructions to install the connector on your distro of choice. Adding the Entries to Cloudflare \u00b6 Now, we need to begin adding the domains. For API, for the subdomain enter the subdomain you chose earlier. In my case api.mydomain Leave \"Path\" empty. For Service, choose HTTPS then in the URL put your server's LOCAL ip and then port 443. Scroll down and extend Additional Application Settings. From here, extend TLS and set Origin Server Name to the subdomain + domain that you're using. Repeat this step for RMM. Mesh is slightly different. For the subdomain, enter the subdomain you chose earlier. In my case mesh.mydomain, still being sure to leave Path empty. For service, pick Type HTTP, and for URL put your server's LOCAL ip then:4430. Extend Additional Application Settings and then HTTP settings and set the HTTP Host Header to the subdomain + domain that you're using. api.{domain} https | TRMM server IP | 443 Advanced: Origin Server Name | api.{domain} mesh.{domain} http | TRMM server IP | 4430 Advanced: HTTP Host Header | mesh.{domain} rmm.{domain} https | TRMM server IP | 443 Advanced: Origin Server Name | rmm.{domain} Now, Mesh will check the external cert when it boots up in order to verify the domain. This will fail as TRMM on setup adds a 127.0.1.1 entry to the /etc/hosts file. To fix this, SSH into your TRMM server and run the following command: nano /etc/hosts On the second line of your hosts file, you should see all the entries listed. 127 .0.1.1 trmm.yourdomain trmm api.yourdomain rmm.yourdomain mesh.yourdomain You need to remove the mesh.yourdomain entry at the end. Once you've done this, you're ready to go. All sites should be accessible and you should be able to add agents and connect/work with them. Caddy 2 \u00b6 This section will cover using Caddy as a reverse proxy in front of TacticalRMM. The below example uses AWS Route53, ports 4443/8080, and assumes you are using Docker. In your Caddyfile, create a wild card route with 3 handlers as shown below. # Caddyfile { email fake@amidaware.com acme_dns route53 } # Global options *.amidaware.com { tls { dns route53 { max_retries 10 access_key_id \"AKIAxxxxxxx\" secret_access_key \"4CXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\" region \"us-east-1\" } } # tls @rmm host rmm.amidaware.com handle @rmm { reverse_proxy rmm.amidaware.com:4443 { transport http { tls_insecure_skip_verify } } } # rmm @api host api.amidaware.com handle @api { reverse_proxy api.amidaware.com:4443 { transport http { tls_insecure_skip_verify } } } # api @mesh host mesh.amidaware.com handle @mesh { reverse_proxy https://mesh.amidaware.com:4443 { transport http { tls_insecure_skip_verify } } } # mesh } # *.amidaware.com In your TacticalRMM .env file, change TRMM_HTTP_PORT and TRMM_HTTPS_PORT so that it matches the port you selected in your Caddyfile. In this example it's 4443 and 8080. Also change the MESH_PERSISTENT_CONFIG to 1 so t> TRMM_HTTP_PORT = 8080 TRMM_HTTPS_PORT = 4443 Update your mesh config certUrl option with your domain Url as shown below. \"domains\": { \"\": { .... \"certUrl\": \"https://rmm.amidaware.com\", \"agentConfig\": [ \"webSocketMaskOverride=0\" ] } }, Restart your Caddy containers docker compose restart Locate and make a note of your Caddy certificate files. In this example it was created in: /mydockercontainers/caddy_data/caddy/certificates/acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org-directory/wildcard_.amidaware.com We need to update TacticalRMM's .env file with the Caddy certificates. Create a script named renew-cert.sh and change CERT_CRT and CERT_KEY to match the location in the previous step. # renew-cert.sh #!/bin/bash CERT_CRT = /mydockercontainers/caddy/caddy_data/caddy/certificates/acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org-directory/wildcard_.amidaware.com/wildcard_.amidaware.com.crt CERT_KEY = /mydockercontainers/caddy/caddy_data/caddy/certificates/acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org-directory/wildcard_.amidaware.com/wildcard_.amidaware.com.key echo \"CERT_PUB_KEY= $( sudo base64 -w 0 ${ CERT_CRT } ) \" >> .env echo \"CERT_PRIV_KEY= $( sudo base64 -w 0 ${ CERT_KEY } ) \" >> .env echo \"Restarting TacticalRMM containers please wait ...\" docker compose down docker compose up -d --remove-orphans echo \"Make sure to remove the old cert lines in .env file.\" Run the script manually when needed or add to cron. chmod +x renew-cert.sh ./renew-cert.sh That's all folks. Caddy should be reverse proxying all traffic to TacticalRMM correctly. Caddy Std Install \u00b6 This is for putting Caddy as a reverse proxy in front of a standard installation of Tactical RMM. It will leave the nginx reverse proxy in place and have double proxies as a result. Caddy Config { auto_https off http_port 80 https_port 443 } #snips (cert) { tls /path/to/your/fullchain.cer /path/to/your/domain.key } #rmm rmm.example.com { import cert encode gzip reverse_proxy YOUR_RMM_IP:443 { transport http { tls_insecure_skip_verify } } } #api api.example.com { import cert encode gzip reverse_proxy YOUR_RMM_IP:443 { transport http { tls_insecure_skip_verify } } } #mesh mesh.example.com { import cert encode gzip reverse_proxy https://mesh.example.com:443 { transport http { tls_insecure_skip_verify } } } For the meshcentral config: { \"settings\": { .... \"tlsOffload\": \"YOUR_CADDY_IP\", .... }, \"domains\": { \"\": { .... \"certUrl\": \"https://YOUR_CADDY_IP:443\", \"agentConfig\": [ \"webSocketMaskOverride=0\" ], .... } } } Traefikv2 \u00b6 Offsite Resource: https://gitlab.com/NiceGuyIT/tactical-goodies/-/tree/main/traefik This section will assume that by default Traefik will reverse proxy everything on port 443. Here is a basic Traefik config with docker-compose. Note, the file.directory and file.watch are important: version: \"3.7\" services: traefik: container_name: traefik24 image: traefik:v2.4 restart: unless-stopped command: - --entryPoints.http.address = :80 - --entryPoints.https.address = :443 - --providers.docker = true - --providers.docker.endpoint = unix:///var/run/docker.sock - --providers.docker.defaultrule = HostHeader ( ` {{ index .Labels \"com.docker.compose.service\" }} . $DOMAINNAME ` ) ## This is important, to load the config for RMM and Mesh - --providers.file.directory = rules # Load dynamic configuration from one or more .toml or .yml files in a directory. - --providers.file.watch = true # Only works on top level files in the rules folder #### - --certificatesresolvers.dns-cloudflare.acme.dnschallenge = true - --certificatesResolvers.dns-cloudflare.acme.email = $CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL - --certificatesResolvers.dns-cloudflare.acme.storage = /acme.json - --certificatesResolvers.dns-cloudflare.acme.dnsChallenge.provider = cloudflare - --certificatesResolvers.dns-cloudflare.acme.dnsChallenge.resolvers = 1 .1.1.1:53,1.0.0.1:53 ports: - target: 80 published: 80 protocol: tcp mode: host - target: 443 published: 443 protocol: tcp mode: host volumes: ##The rules that we will load## - $USERDIR /docker/traefik2/rules:/rules ## - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro - $USERDIR /docker/traefik2/acme/acme.json:/acme.json - $USERDIR /docker/traefik2/traefik.log:/traefik.log environment: - CF_API_EMAIL = $CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL - CF_API_KEY = $CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY labels: - \"traefik.enable=true\" # HTTP-to-HTTPS Redirect - \"traefik.http.routers.http-catchall.entrypoints=http\" - \"traefik.http.routers.http-catchall.rule=HostRegexp(`{host:.+}`)\" - \"traefik.http.routers.http-catchall.middlewares=redirect-to-https\" - \"traefik.http.middlewares.redirect-to-https.redirectscheme.scheme=https\" # HTTP Routers - \"traefik.http.routers.traefik-rtr.entrypoints=https\" - \"traefik.http.routers.traefik-rtr.rule=HostHeader(`traefik. $DOMAINNAME `)\" - \"traefik.http.routers.traefik-rtr.tls=true\" - \"traefik.http.routers.traefik-rtr.tls.domains[0].main= $DOMAINNAME \" - \"traefik.http.routers.traefik-rtr.tls.domains[0].sans=*. $DOMAINNAME \" Before proceeding, we need to change the port 443 to 4443 and 80 to 8080 because the port 443 and 80 are already used by Traefik. Here is a snippet of the only thing you should modify into docker-compose file of the installation: # container for tactical reverse proxy tactical-nginx: container_name: trmm-nginx image: ${ IMAGE_REPO } tactical-nginx: ${ VERSION } restart: always environment: APP_HOST: ${ APP_HOST } API_HOST: ${ API_HOST } MESH_HOST: ${ MESH_HOST } CERT_PUB_KEY: ${ CERT_PUB_KEY } CERT_PRIV_KEY: ${ CERT_PRIV_KEY } networks: proxy: ipv4_address: 172 .20.0.20 ports: - \"8080:8080\" ## port 8080 instead of 80 - \"4443:4443\" ## port 4443 instead of 443 Once saved, make sure you run the docker-compose or installation script at least once, so all the directory structures are created. Once you have your certificate (acme.json) generated by traefikv2 we will be able to extract it for rmm. Copy the acme.json create by traefik into the root of your rmm directory (In my case it's $USERDIR/docker/rmm) which you should have already defined. After that we can run this docker to extract the certificates for us: version: \"3.7\" services: ##Copy the acme.json of Traefik2 at volumes: (userdir/docker/rmm in this case) traefik-certs-dumper: image: ldez/traefik-certs-dumper:v2.7.4 entrypoint: sh -c ' apk add jq ; while ! [ -e /data/acme.json ] || ! [ `jq \".[] | .Certificates | length\" /data/acme.json` != 0 ]; do sleep 1 ; done && traefik-certs-dumper file --version v2 --watch --source /data/acme.json --dest data/certs' volumes: - $USERDIR /docker/rmm:/data Once completed, you should have 1 new folder in your rmm directory $USERDIR/docker/rmm/ certs in this example. As the installation instruction, we will pass those to the .env: echo \"CERT_PUB_KEY= $( sudo base64 -w 0 $USERDIR /docker/rmm/certs/certs/**yourdomain.com.crt** ) \" >> .env echo \"CERT_PRIV_KEY= $( sudo base64 -w 0 $USERDIR /docker/rmm/certs/private/**yourdomain.com.key** ) \" >> .env Next we can create 3 rules to tell Traefik to correctly route the https and agent. For that we will create 2 rules into Traefik directory as per it's configuration. folder/traefik/rules create: nano app-mesh.toml and inside it we add: [ http.routers ] [ http.routers.mesh-rtr ] entryPoints = [ \"https\" ] rule = \"Host(`mesh.**yourdomain.com**`)\" service = \"mesh-svc\" ##middleware with 2FA [ http.services ] [ http.services.mesh-svc ] [ http.services.mesh-svc.loadBalancer ] passHostHeader = true [[ http.services.mesh-svc.loadBalancer.servers ]] url = \"https://**xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx**:4443\" # or whatever your external host's IP is create: nano app-meshagent.toml and inside it we add: [ http.routers ] [ http.routers.mesh-rtr1 ] entryPoints = [ \"https\" ] rule = \"\"\"Host(`mesh.**yourdomain.com**`) && PathPrefix( `/agent.ashx`, `/meshrelay.ashx`, ) && Headers(`X-Forwarded-Proto`, `wss`) \"\"\" ##Don't add middle where, the agent wont work. [ http.services ] [ http.services.mesh-svc1 ] [ http.services.mesh-svc.loadBalancer ] passHostHeader = true [[ http.services.mesh-svc1.loadBalancer.servers ]] url = \"https://**xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx**:4443\" # or whatever your external host's IP is create: nano app-rmm.toml and inside it we add: [ http.routers ] [ http.routers.rmm-rtr ] entryPoints = [ \"https\" ] rule = \"Host(`rmm.**yourdomain.com**`)\" service = \"rmm-svc\" ##middleware with 2FA [ http.services ] [ http.services.rmm-svc ] [ http.services.rmm-svc.loadBalancer ] passHostHeader = true [[ http.services.rmm-svc.loadBalancer.servers ]] url = \"https://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:4443\" # or whatever your external host's IP:port is That's it, you can now restart Tactical. rmm and mesh.yourdomain.com should work, same for the agent. Please note that if you have a middleware with 2FA you can still use it with the inside mesh.toml, but do not add it with the agent. HAProxy \u00b6 Check / change the MeshCentral config.json, some of the values may be set already. CertUrl must be changed to point to the HAProxy server if not using the same certs for both HAProxy and TRMM. MeshCentral Adjustment \u00b6 Credit to @bradhawkins Edit MeshCentral config: nano /meshcentral/meshcentral-data/config.json Insert this (modify HAProxyIP to your network): { \"settings\": { \"Port\": 4443, \"AliasPort\": 443, \"RedirPort\": 8080, \"TlsOffload\": \"127.0.0.1\", }, \"domains\": { \"\": { \"CertUrl\": \"https://HAProxyIP:443/\", } } } Restart MeshCentral: systemctl meshcentral restart NGINX ADJUSTMENTS \u00b6 You will need to edit the nginx.conf file in the http section on the trmm server to recognize the X-Forwarded-For Header that will be sent from haproxy. Edit file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf Add the lines from 'real_ip' module inside http tag: set_real_ip_from 192.168.0.200; #IP Address of your haproxy server real_ip_header X-Forwarded-For; Restart nginx: systemctl restart nginx.service HAProxy Config \u00b6 The order of use_backend is important, and Tactical-Mesh-WebSocket_ipvANY must be before Tactical-Mesh_ipvANY . This assumes a standard VM install or Docker instance, unaltered . If you've altered exposed ports on your VM or Docker instance, those will need to be adjusted in the configuration. The values of timeout connect , timeout server , and timeout tunnel have been configured to maintain a stable agent connection, however you may need to adjust these values to suit your environment: frontend http-to-https-shared bind 0.0.0.0:80 mode http log global option socket-stats option http-server-close option dontlognull option forwardfor acl https ssl_fc http-request set-header X-Forwarded-Proto http if !https http-request set-header X-Forwarded-Proto https if https http-request add-header X-Real-IP %[src] timeout client 30000 acl rmm var(txn.txnhost) -m str -i rmm.example.com acl api var(txn.txnhost) -m str -i api.example.com acl mesh var(txn.txnhost) -m str -i mesh.example.com http-request set-var(txn.txnhost) hdr(host) http-request redirect scheme https if rmm http-request redirect scheme https if api http-request redirect scheme https if mesh frontend https-shared bind 0.0.0.0:443 ssl crt-list /var/etc/haproxy/HTTPS.crt_list #ADJUST THIS TO YOUR OWN SSL CERTIFICATES mode http log global option socket-stats option dontlognull option http-server-close option forwardfor acl https ssl_fc http-request set-header X-Forwarded-Proto http if !https http-request set-header X-Forwarded-Proto https if https timeout client 30000 acl aclcrt_https_shared var(txn.txnhost) -m reg -i ^([^\\.]*)\\.example\\.com(:([0-9]){1,5})?$ acl rmm var(txn.txnhost) -m str -i rmm.example.com acl nats-websocket var(txn.txnpath) -m sub -i /natsws acl api var(txn.txnhost) -m str -i api.example.com acl is_websocket hdr(Upgrade) -i WebSocket acl mesh var(txn.txnhost) -m str -i mesh.example.com acl api-ws var(txn.txnhost) -m sub -i api.example.com http-request set-var(txn.txnhost) hdr(host) http-request set-var(txn.txnpath) path use_backend rmm.example.com_ipvANY if rmm use_backend rmm.example.com-websocket_ipvANY if nats-websocket api-ws use_backend rmm.example.com_ipvANY if api use_backend mesh.example.com-websocket_ipvANY if is_websocket mesh use_backend mesh.example.com_ipvANY if mesh backend rmm.example.com_ipvANY mode http log global timeout connect 30000 timeout server 30000 retries 3 http-request add-header X-Forwarded-Host %[req.hdr(Host)] http-request add-header X-Forwarded-Proto https server rmm x.x.x.x:443 ssl verify none backend rmm.example.com-websocket_ipvANY mode http log global timeout connect 30000 timeout server 30000 retries 3 timeout tunnel 3600000 http-request add-header X-Forwarded-Host %[req.hdr(Host)] http-request add-header X-Forwarded-Proto https server rmm-websocket x.x.x.x:443 ssl verify none backend mesh.example.com-websocket_ipvANY mode http log global timeout connect 3000 timeout server 3000 retries 3 timeout tunnel 3600000 http-request add-header X-Forwarded-Host %[req.hdr(Host)] http-request add-header X-Forwarded-Proto https server mesh-websocket x.x.x.x:443 ssl verify none backend mesh.example.com_ipvANY mode http log global timeout connect 15000 timeout server 15000 retries 3 timeout tunnel 15000 http-request add-header X-Forwarded-Host %[req.hdr(Host)] http-request add-header X-Forwarded-Proto https server mesh x.x.x.x:443 ssl verify none HAProxy How-to for pfSense \u00b6 https://github.com/ninjamonkey198206/T-RMM-PFSense-HAProxy-config HAProxy How-to for Baremetal \u00b6 https://github.com/ninjamonkey198206/T-RMM-Baremetal-HAProxy HAProxy in TCP Mode, pfSense \u00b6 In this scenario, you install TRMM as per documentation. Meaning your certificates are generated and managed on your TRMM server, just use the install.sh and follow docs and on-screen instructions.

Then in NPM, declare the hosts with the parameters: api.{domain} https | TRMM server DNS name | 443 ON: Cache Assets | Block Common Exploits | Websockets Support mesh.{domain} https | TRMM server DNS name | 443 ON: Block Common Exploits | Websockets Support Advanced: proxy_set_header Host $host; proxy_set_header CF-Connecting-IP $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host:$server_port; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme; rmm.{domain} https | TRMM server DNS name | 443 ON: Cache Assets | Block Common Exploits | Websockets Support Last thing you have to do, is setup the same certs on NPM and TRMM. TRMM cert location: /etc/letsencrypt/live/{yourdomain}/ NPM cert location: SSL Certificates tab Either: Setup SSL certs on NPM (optionally using Cloudflare API). Download and copy certs to TRMM. Then run ./update.sh --force OR: Run standard TRMM cert renew process using certbot. Then copy the files and upload: Certificate Key ( privkey.pem ), Certificate ( cert.pem ), and Intermediate Certificate ( chain.pem ) Nginx Proxy Manager Alt Method \u00b6 Note Tested and working on the following: \u2705 TRMM hosted on Ubuntu 22.04 via Proxmox VM \u2705 Nginx Proxy Manager hosted on Debian 11 via Proxmox CT W/ Docker We'll use \"YOURDOMAIN\" in place of your actual domain name Step 1 - Install and test TRMM with no proxy \u00b6 First and foremost, you need to disable Nginx Proxy Manager. To do this, on your routers firewall settings, forward ports 443 and 80 to the local ip that will be running your TRMM instance. This is only temporary as we want to make sure we can get TRMM installed and running with a STANDARD install FIRST. You will also need to make sure the following subdomains are pointing to your external IP: api.YOURDOMAIN.com rmm.YOURDOMAIN.com mesh.YOURDOMAIN.com Use curl icanhazip.com to pull your external IP if you don't know it. Once you have ports 443 and 80 forwarded correctly, go ahead and run a STANDARD install of TRMM on a FRESH machine. You can find the Install Documentation here . Step 2 - Nginx Proxy Manager Proxy Host Configuration \u00b6 Assuming you installed TRMM properly and all of its features are working correctly, we will now get into setting up Nginx Proxy Manager to work with TRMM. Go ahead and forward ports 443 and 80 back to your Nginx Proxy Manager instance. Below you will find the 3 different Proxy Hosts you need to create on Nginx Proxy Manager. \"API\" Domain \u00b6 Details Tab: Domain Name: --> api.YOURDOMAIN.com Scheme: --> https Forward Hostname / IP: --> The Local IP of your TRMM instance. ie: 192.168.1.155 Forward Port: --> 443 Enabled Options: Cache Assets; Block Common Exploits; Websockets Support Access List: --> Publicly Accessible \"MESH\" Domain \u00b6 Details Tab: Domain Name: --> mesh.YOURDOMAIN.com Scheme: --> http Forward Hostname / IP: --> The Local IP of your TRMM instance. ie: 192.168.1.155 Forward Port: --> 4430 Enabled Options: Block Common Exploits; Websockets Support Access List: --> Publicly Accessible Advanced Tab: Custom Nginx Configuration proxy_set_header Host $host; proxy_set_header CF-Connecting-IP $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host:$server_port; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme; \"RMM\" Domain \u00b6 Details Tab: Domain Name: --> rmm.YOURDOMAIN.com Scheme: --> https Forward Hostname / IP: --> The Local IP of your TRMM instance. ie: 192.168.1.155 Forward Port: --> 443 Enabled Options: Cache Assets; Block Common Exploits; Websockets Support Access List: --> Publicly Accessible NPM SSL Configuration \u00b6 In order for TRMM to work properly with NPM, you'll need to create a wildcard or multi-domain SSL Certificate. To do this, on the Nginx Proxy Manager Dashboard, click the SSL Certificates tab. Now in the top right, click \"Add SSL Certificate\". Select \"Let's Encrypt\". Add each of the domains listed above to the \"Domain Names\" field. Make sure you add them 1 at a time and click the dropdown of the domain to add it. Once you've added all 3 domains, enable the \"I agree\" tick and click save. You should now see something like this in your list of SSL Certs: Go ahead and download this certificate by clicking the 3 dots to the right of the cert entry and click \"Download\". I suggest you follow these instructions for adding the new certs to your TRMM instance. You will still need to keep TRMM's certs updated as well. MeshCentral Configuration \u00b6 Now you should have Nginx Proxy Manager completely setup. Lets move on to the MeshCentral Configuration. First, cd to /meshcentral/meshcentral-data Now edit the file named config.json . Make sure your config file looks like the one shown below. { \"settings\" : { \"cert\" : \"mesh.YOURDOMAIN.com\" , .... \"tlsOffload\" : \"Nginx Proxy Manager Local IP\" , \"trustedProxy\" : \"Nginx Proxy Manager Local IP\" , .... }, \"domains\" : { \"\" : { .... \"certUrl\" : \"https://mesh.YOURDOMAIN.com:443/\" , .... } } } If you want to enable logging in case anything goes wrong during this process, follow the instructions here . As of now, everything should be working. If you have any issues, feel free to join the discord . Keep in mind, this is considered an UNSUPPORTED installation. Developers are not obligated to fix any issues you may encounter. Good luck. Synology NAS Reverse Proxy Portal \u00b6 Follow HAProxy And set the \"CertUrl\" to point to the IP address of my NAS that was running the reserve proxy and had the certificates installed.

While it has started working again, there are no guarantees that this will continue to work. Use at your own risk. First, just complete a TRMM install like normal- you don't need to put the API, RMM, or Mesh domains into Cloudflare however. You must still follow the TXT record to prove that it's your domain.

Scroll down and extend Additional Application Settings. From here, extend TLS and set Origin Server Name to the subdomain + domain that you're using. Repeat this step for RMM. Mesh is slightly different. For the subdomain, enter the subdomain you chose earlier. In my case mesh.mydomain, still being sure to leave Path empty.

The toolbar along the top has various formating options for text and some useful functions for building dynamic reports. Reports are built using the Jinja templating engine. A reference guide and be found Here . Reporting formats \u00b6 You can write report templates using Markdown , HTML , or Plain Text . HTML and Markdown reports will look the same regardless of choice. Templates cannot be converted between formats, but it would be easy enough to do the conversion manually between markdown and HTML Markdown templates \u00b6 Do note that HTML is valid in markdown and should be used when the Markdown syntax doesn't do exactly what you need. An example would be for using the <table> tag. Also note that the markdown is rendered to HTML anyway. See this reference for Markdown syntax Plain text templates \u00b6 Plain Text templates are a great choice if you just want to generate some text without all of the formatting. This is very useful if you want a CSV export of some data. The toolbar \u00b6 The toolbar along the top of the editor provides some shortcuts for commonly used functions. Most of the buttons are used for text formatting, but there are some shortcuts for adding/editing data queries, base templates, and inserting charts and tables. Hovering over the button will display its function. Variables \u00b6 You can add in variables in the right editor pane. The variables pane can be toggled on/off using the vars button on the toolbar. The variables are adding in yaml format and can be referenced using {{variable_name}} in the template. The value of the variable will be substituted when the template is rendered. If the value of the variables is nested within an object, you can use dot notation to render the value like {{ object.variable_name }} . If there is a space in the name you can use {{ object[\"variable name\"] }} . Variable analysis \u00b6 With data sources and other dynamic sources, it can be difficult to view what the data looks like to use in report templates. With variable analysis, the query is ran and the available properties are returned. Click on the > arrow on the top left of the editor window (under the toolbar) to see the available properties from the variables section. You can then click on them to copy and you can paste them into the template. For array values, you can click the For loop button and paste in a Jinja for loop to easily loop over the properties. Data queries \u00b6 Data queries are a way to save commonly used queries and use them in templates. Data queries are added under the data_sources key in the variables section. If the key doesn't exist, it will be created Adding data queries \u00b6 Using the Add Data Query button on the toolbar, it will open the data query editor. This editor will let you know the valid syntax of the query and supports auto-complete. If you are stumped and need to know all of the values that are supported you can press Ctrl+Space and a dropdown will show. Once you add the query, it will be auto-inserted into the template. You can also add a data query from the Report Manager and open the Data Queries button along the top. This is the save function as using the toolbar, but it will save the query to allow it to be used in templates. Inserting saved data queries \u00b6 You can insert a saved data query using the Insert Data Query button on the toolbar. You just have to select the data query from the drop down and it will insert it into the template. Editing data queries \u00b6 You can edit data queries in the template by clicking the Edit Data Query button on the toolbar. This will list the currently added data_sources into a dropdown and allow you to edit them in the auto complete editor. Clicking save will replace the data query in the variables with the updated one. Report output format \u00b6 Reports can be output in either HTML , PDF , or in Plain Text format. HTML and Markdown Template types \u00b6 HTML and Markdown template types and be output in PDF or HTML formats. These template types don't support plain text output. Plain Text \u00b6 Plain text template types can be output in PDF or text. This template type doesn't support html output. Putting markdown or anything else in a plain text template will just output the same markdown. It isn't processed through the markdown library. CSS \u00b6 CSS can be embedded in the report template using the CSS tab on the top right on the report template editor. The CSS class can be referenced in the report template for styling. If you are using markdown, you can add ids and classes to html elements by using {#id_name} and {.class_name} beside the template. This will render an h1 html tag with an id of 'id-name' {#id-name} This will render an h1 html tag with a class of 'class-name' {.class-name} Report assets \u00b6 Assets can be served from your Tactical RMM instance. They will need to be uploaded to the Asset Manager first. This can be accessed from the Reporting Manager windows by clicking on the Report Assets. Once uploaded, click on the Image button on the toolbar and select the Report Asset radio button. From there you can click on an asset and go to Insert. Base templates \u00b6 Base Templates allow you to use the same report structure throughout multiple reports. The base template should be a full html document enclosed in an html tag. To specify content that should be overridden in the child template, you can use Jinja blocks in the base template. See this example in the Jinja documentation. You can add a base template from the report template editor by clicking the base button on the toolbar. When you select a base template (using the dropdown) in a report template, the extends block will automatically be inserted. You can click on the variable analysis button (top-left arrow) to see which blocks in the base template need to be overridden yet. Clicking on the block in variable analysis will copy the text to the clipboard and will need to be copied into the template. Template dependencies \u00b6 Sometimes you need to provide data during a reports runtime. This could be a specific client, a date range, etc. This is achievable by setting a template dependency using the Template Dependencies dropdown on the report editor. Then default values are Client, Site, and Agent. You can type additional values that are required for the report. In your variables and report template, you can use these dependencies by enclosing the same of the dependency like so: {{agent.hostname}} or {{client.name}} . For custom dependencies you can just type in {{ dependency_name }} . These are case sensitive. Report preview \u00b6 You can easily see what a report is going to look like by pressing the Preview button on the top right of the editor window. You can choose between an HTML or PDF output using the radio buttons. If you have report dependencies, a dialog box will show asking you to fill in the values that should be used to generate the report. Debug \u00b6 if you need additional info showing the values of the variables and the rendered HTML, you can check the debug button. This will show at the bottom of the preview window. Running a report \u00b6 Running a report can be done from the Reporting Manager by right-clicking on the report template and either running as an HTML or PDF report. The report will open up in a separate window. If there are report dependencies, a dialog will prompt to populate the values. You can save the URL or bookmark it to easily generate the same report without having to populate the dependencies. If you have a Client, Site, or Agent dependency specified in the report, you can also right-click on the respective entity in Tactical RMM and go to Integrations > Run Report . You can then specify a report output type and the entity that you right-clicked on will automatically populate as a dependency.","title":"- The Basics"},{"location":"ee/reporting/functions/reporting_basics/#the-basics","text":"This template will show case the basics of reporting and also give some examples on how to use them.

Data queries are defined in the variables editor under the data_sources object. There is a predefined format that the data query must follow and it is defined using a JSON or yaml syntax. At it's simplest form, a data query just specifies a model. Doing this will pull all of the records and columns available from the table. This is an example of a data query that pulls all columns and rows from the sites table. data_sources : sites : model : site Once this is specified in the variables, you can use this data in the template like this: {{data_sources.sites}} . This will just dump the data into the template, but it isn't very useful. We can actually loop over this data query to format it using a Jinja for loop. {% for item in data_sources.sites %} {{item.name}} {% endfor %} This will print out the name of every site on a new line. We can have multiple data_sources specified also like so. data_sources : sites : model : site clients : model : client The same rules apply for the second query. You can reference it in your templates using {{data_sources.clients}} . Template Dependencies \u00b6 Template dependencies allow you to pass information to a report at runtime. This could be a client, site, or agent. These are covered in detail in the documentation, but just know that you can use template dependencies in your data queries by using the {{ }} in place of the data you want to replace. See the example below for a client dependency: data_sources : sites : model : site filter : client_id : '{{ client.id }}' Note Note that quotes are required around {{}} tags in the variables section Data Query Editor \u00b6 There is a data query editor that supports auto-complete so that you can more easily determine which columns and relations are available. It is recommended to always use this editor to avoid typos and errors when generating reports. You can open the query editor by going to Reports Manager > Data Queries > New or in the template editor by clicking Add Data Query or Edit Data Query toolbar button in the template. Do note that the Query Editor uses JSON syntax to provide the auto-complete functionality. You can either start typing to trigger the auto-complete list, or press the Ctrl+Alt key. Syntax \u00b6 Below are the allowed properties in a data query. You can combine these properties together is the same data query unless specifically noted. model - string \u00b6 The only required field for a data query is the model . This tells the system which database table to pull the data from. The available models are: Visualized version agent agentcustomfield agenthistory note alert auditlog automatedtask check checkhistory checkresult chocosoftware client clientcustomfield debuglog globalkvstore pendingaction policy site taskresult winupdate winupdatepolicy only - array of strings \u00b6 Only is useful for only pulling certain columns. This is recommended if you are pulling data from the agents table since services and wmi_detail columns are very large and can take a long time to run. A few examples of using only. data_sources : sites : model : site only : - name - failing_checks clients : model : client only : - name - failing_checks agents : model : agent only : - hostname - operating_system - plat defer \u00b6 To not load some fields by default to limit data from being pulled, unless it is needed later for some reason. custom_fields - array of strings \u00b6 This is only applicable to the client , site , and agent model. You can pass an array of strings with names of custom fields and it will inject them into the data. Lets say we have these custom fields configured: Client - custom_field - Custom Field 2 Site - another Custom Field - no_spaces Agent - agent_custom_field We can pull this data in a data query like this: data_sources : clients : model : client only : - name - failing_checks custom_fields : - custom_field - Custom Field 2 sites : model : site only : - name - failing_checks custom_fields : - another Custom Field - no_spaces agents : model : agent only : - hostname - operating_system - plat custom_fields : - agent_custom_field The custom field names are case sensitive and the custom field must be configured in the system or no custom data will be pulled. A custom_fields object is added to the data and is accessible in the template. You can access the custom field data for the clients data query like this: {% for item in data_source.clients %} {{ item.custom_fields.custom_field }} {{ item.custom_fields[\"Custom Field 2\"] }} {% endfor %} Note that you can't use dot notation for a property if it has spaces. See the above example for the Custom Field 2 property filter - object \u00b6 Using the filter property, you can filter the amount of rows that are returned. This is useful if you only want a agents for a particular client or site, or you only want agents tht are pending a reboot. See below for an example: data_sources : agents : model : agent only : - hostname - operating_system - plat - needs_reboot filter : needs_reboot : True This data query will only return agents that need a reboot. We can also add a second filter like so. data_sources : agents : model : agent only : - hostname - operating_system - plat - needs_reboot filter : needs_reboot : True plat : \"windows\" The above is just doing an equals comparison to make sure the rows match. You can also use other operations like greater than, contains, etc. data_sources : agents : model : agent only : - hostname - operating_system - plat - needs_reboot filter : operating_system__contains : \"22H2\" To use the contains filter, we need to append two underscores (_) and type in the field lookup. This just uses the django built in field lookups.A full list can be found Here exclude - object \u00b6 We can use this to exclude rows from our data. The same rules apply for filter apply here. (See above) Example data_sources : agents : model : agent only : - hostname - operating_system - plat - needs_reboot exclude : plat : \"linux\" limit - number \u00b6 This will limit the number of returned rows in the data. Example data_sources : agents : model : agent only : - hostname - operating_system - plat - needs_reboot limit : 400 get - boolean \u00b6 Instead of returning a list, the data query will attempt to return a single object. This is best used with a filter that guarantees a single row returned, i.e: filtering by id. This will error out if the query returns more than one object.

Example data_sources : agents : model : agent only : - hostname - operating_system - plat - needs_reboot - site__name - site__client__name filter : site__client__name : \"Client Name\" csv : true This will add a site__name and site__client__name column on the returned data. We use a double underscore every time we want to go to another table. The site column exists directly on the agents table. So in order to get the name (which resides on the sites table) we need to use the double underscore. Same thing with the client name. We need to go through the sites table in order to get the client name so we use another double underscore. Usage in template {{data_sources.agents}} Output will look something like: hostname,operating_system, plat,needs_reboot,site__name,site__client__name data,data,data,data,data,data You can also rename the columns by passing a mapping into csv like so: data_sources : agents : model : agent only : - hostname - operating_system - plat - needs_reboot - site__name - site__client__name filter : site__client__name : \"Client Name\" csv : hostname : Hostname operating_system : Operating System plat : Platform needs_reboot : Needs Reboot site__name : Site Name site__client__name : Client Name Which would return something like Hostname,Operating System,Platform,Needs Reboot,Site Name,Client Name data,data,data,data,data,data json - boolean \u00b6 This will return a json string representation of the object. This is useful if you are passing the data source to be processed by javascript.

You may have a data query using the agents table, but want to include the Site name and the Client name. See the example below: data_sources : agents : model : agent only : - hostname - operating_system - plat - needs_reboot - site__name - site__client__name This will add a site__name and site__client__name column on the returned data.

So in order to get the name (which resides on the sites table) we need to use the double underscore. Same thing with the client name.

This approach enables you to configure any compatible provider by simply entering its URL, giving you the freedom to choose the identity provider that best suits your needs without specific provider dependencies. Video Walkthru \u00b6 License \u00b6 The SSO feature is released under the Tactical RMM Enterprise License and requires a Tier 1 or higher sponsorship. Enable SSO \u00b6 SSO can be enabled via Global Settings > SSO . There is also an option to block regular user logins, allowing only SSO sign-ons (with the exception of local superusers). Add OIDC Provider \u00b6 Provider Name: A unique identifier for the SSO provider. Name this whatever you want, but avoid spaces and special characters, as this will be part of the callback URL. This name will appear on the Tactical RMM Login page. Issuer URL: The OpenID Connect Issuer URL provided by the SSO provider. This is typically the base URL where the provider hosts their OIDC configuration.

Following these instructions and copying/pasting names exactly will result in successful connections. Security \u00b6 When using SSO, the security of your application depends on the configuration of your chosen authentication provider. While local TRMM accounts enforce mandatory 2FA for enhanced security, SSO providers may not require 2FA by default. To maintain strong security, ensure that your SSO provider is configured with 2FA or equivalent measures to protect user accounts. For those who have no interest in using this feature and want it completely disabled, SSO can be disabled at the filesystem level, which will override the setting in Global Settings in the web interface. Disable SSO at the filesystem level Standard install Docker install Append the following variable to /rmm/api/tacticalrmm/tacticalrmm/local_settings.py TRMM_DISABLE_SSO = True Restart the following services: sudo systemctl restart rmm daphne Add TRMM_DISABLE_SSO=True to your .env file and run docker compose down && docker compose up -d How do I activate SSO as a new sponsor? \u00b6 Ignore the following if you're an existing sponsor upgrading from a version below 0.20.0, as SSO will automatically be activated for you during the upgrade process. Make sure your server has an appropriate code signing token saved ( Settings > Code Signing). Run the update script with the --force flag (see instructions below for standard vs docker installs): Hard reload the web page. Make sure you use your browser's reload button to hard reload the page. Standard install Docker install cd ~ wget -N https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amidaware/tacticalrmm/master/update.sh chmod +x update.sh ./update.sh --force docker compose down docker compose up -d For any issues with activating SSO, open a ticket . Troubleshooting \u00b6 Note SSO errors are typically logged on your provider's side. Check your authentication provider's error logs for more detailed messages. There was an error logging into your provider \u00b6 If you encounter the following error message: \"There was an error logging into your provider.\" this typically indicates one of the following issues: Email Address Conflict This error often occurs if there is an existing TRMM local account with the same email address as the SSO account you are trying to log in with. To resolve this: Option 1 : Edit the TRMM local user and update its email address to a different value, such as user@fakedomain.com . Note: The email address field for local users is not currently used for any functionality, so it can be set to any value. Option 2 : Delete the conflicting TRMM local user.

All an alert template does is configure the Email, Text, and Dashboard alert check boxes on Agents, Checks, and Automated Tasks. Using Alert Templates also enables additional features like: Periodic notifications if an alert is left unresolved. Being able to notify on certain alert severities. Sending notifications when an alert is resolved. Executing scripts when an alert is triggered or resolved. Setting up Email Alert Examples Supported Notifications \u00b6 Email Alerts - Sends email to configured set of email addresses. SMS Alerts - Sends text messages to configured set of numbers. Dashboard Alerts - A notification popup will show up and be visible in the dashboard. Webhooks - Send an API request. Alert Severities \u00b6 Info Agent overdue alerts are always of severity: Error Alert severities are configured directly on the Check or Automated Task. When the Check or Automated Task fails, it will create an alert of the specified severity. The severity types are: Informational Warning Error Creating Alert Templates \u00b6 To create an alert template, go to Settings > Alerts Manager , then click New . The available options are: General Settings \u00b6 Name - The name that is used to identify the Alert Template in the dashboard. Email Recipients - Sets the list of email recipients. If this isn't set the email recipients in global settings will be used. From Email - Sets the From email address of the notification. If this isn't set the From address from global settings is used. SMS Recipients - Sets the list of text recipients. If this isn't set the sms list from global settings is used. Alert Action Settings \u00b6 For optionally triggering an additional task (Send a Web Hook, Run Script on Agent, Run script on TRMM Server) when desired (can be left blank for no action). Alert Failure Settings / Alert Resolved Settings \u00b6 Send a Web Hook \u00b6 You can create your own webhooks to be sent out on alert failure/resolved events, like a script check or task failing or an agent going overdue. You have access to any of the variables as well as custom fields / global keystore inside the json payload of the webhook as well as in the URL patter. Create your Web Hooks Choose the Web Hook you wish to be ran as the alert failure and/or resolved action. Run script on Agent \u00b6 Script - Runs the selected script once. It attempts to run it on the agent in question, but if not online TRMM selects a random agent to run on. Script arguments - Optionally pass in arguments to the script. Script environment vars - Optionally pass in env vars to the script. Action Timeout - Sets the timeout for the script. Run script on Server \u00b6 Warning This is a dangerous feature and you must ensure permissions are appropriate for your environment. This runs the script on your TRMM server. To ensure proper execution, you must specify the interpreter for your script using a shebang line at the top of each script. Also make sure that the specified interpreter is installed on your TRMM server. Just like with webhooks, you also have access to the same variables as well as custom fields / global keystore in the script's arguments or environment variables.

Run actions only on \u00b6 Turn the switch on if you want the above Alert Failure/Alert Resolved script to run on: Agents - If Enabled, will run script failure / resolved actions on agent overdue alerts, else no alert actions will be triggered for agent overdue alerts. Checks - If Enabled, will run script failure / resolved actions on check alerts, else no alert actions will be triggered check alerts. Tasks - If Enabled, will run script failure / resolved actions on automated task alerts, else no alert actions will be triggered automated task alerts. Agent Overdue Setting \u00b6 Email - When Enabled , will send an email notification and override the Email Alert checkbox on the Agent / Check / Task. When Not Configured , the Email Alert checkbox on the Agent / Check / Task will take effect. If Disabled , no email notifications will be sent and will override any Email alert checkbox on the Agent / Check / Task. Text - When Enabled , will send a text notification and override the SMS Alert checkbox on the Agent / Check / Task. When Not Configured , the SMS Alert checkbox on the Agent / Check / Task will take effect. If Disabled , no SMS notifications will be sent and will override any SMS Alert checkbox on the Agent / Check / Task.

When Not Configured , the Dashboard Alert checkbox on the Agent / Check / Task will take effect. If Disabled , no SMS notifications will be sent and will override any Dashboard Alert checkbox on the Agent / Check / Task. Alert again if not resolved after (days) - This sends another notification if the alert isn't resolved after the set amount of days. Set to 0 to disable this. Alert on severity - Only applicable to Check and Task alert notifications. This will only send alerts when they are of the configured severity. Info Alert on Severity needs to be configured for check and task notifications to be sent! Check Settings / Automated Task Settings \u00b6 Email - If enabled, sends an email notification when an alert is resolved. Text - If enabled, sends a text messaged when an alert is resolved. Applying Alert Templates \u00b6 Alert templates can be configured: Globally at the Server Level By Automation Policy Manually at the Client Level Manually at the Site Level To apply Globally , navigate to Settings > Global Settings . Set the Alert Template dropdown and save. You can configure an alert template on an automation policy by navigating to Settings > Automation Manager , and clicking the Assign Alert Template click on the policy, or right-clicking the policy and selecting Assign Alert Template . To configure on a Client or Site right-click on one in the Client / Site tree view and select Assign Alert Template . Alert Template Exclusions \u00b6 You can exclude Clients, Sites, and Agents from Alert Templates. To do this you can: Right-click on the Alert Template in Alerts Manager and select Exclusions . Select the Alert Exclusions link in the Alert Template row. You can also Exclude Desktops from the alert template. This is useful if you only care about servers. Alert Template Inheritance \u00b6 Alerts are applied in the following order. The agent picks the closest matching alert template.

Then, perform the action you wish to do via the api in Tactical's web interface and watch the network tab to see the endpoint and the payload that is generated, and use that as an example of how to structure your api request. Please note that using an API key will bypass 2FA authentication. When creating the key you'll need to choose a user, which will reflect what permissions the key has based on the user's role.

Please note that using an API key will bypass 2FA authentication. When creating the key you'll need to choose a user, which will reflect what permissions the key has based on the user's role. Navigate to Settings > Global Settings > API Keys to generate a key. Warning Pay attention to your trailing / they matter.

Task Triggers \u00b6 Time-Based \u00b6 Daily, Weekly, or Monthly : Schedule tasks to run at regular intervals, as expected. Note: On Linux and macOS, tasks will execute based on the \"Start Time\" field, ignoring the date portion. For example, a daily task set to start at 12:55 PM will run at that time every day starting from when the task is created. Run Once : For future dates, tasks run as scheduled. For past dates, tasks are created to run 5 minutes after being registered with the Windows Task Scheduler. This ensures the task runs at least once, as the scheduler will not execute tasks with past \"Run Once\" dates. On Check Failure \u00b6 Automatically trigger a script to address issues when a Check fails. Onboarding \u00b6 Use this type of task to execute \"Run Once\" scripts during agent onboarding. These tasks run immediately after the task is created on the agent, which happens a few minutes after the install of a new agent. Ideal for: - Setting workstation defaults - Installing software - Configuring machines Integrate these tasks with Automation Policies to streamline the setup of new devices. Manual \u00b6 Manually triggered tasks for on-demand operations. Example: A Windows Defender Cleanup Task might perform the following when manually triggered: 1. Delete all Shadow Copies from VSS. 2. Create a new VSS Snapshot. 3. Clear Defender logs to prevent duplicate alerts. 4. Run a full Defender scan. This is useful for addressing alerts about Defender detections (e.g., malware or adware in download folders). Task Actions \u00b6 Execute any script from your Script Library , or use Batch or PowerShell commands. Configure multiple scripts/commands to run sequentially. Optionally continue or halt the sequence based on errors. Collector Tasks \u00b6 Collector tasks allow you to save script output directly to a custom field. How to Create Collector Tasks \u00b6 Add the task to an Automation Policy or directly to an agent. During task creation: Select the Collector checkbox. Choose the custom field where the output should be saved. Note Currently, you can only save data to agent-level custom fields.

Run Command on many agents at once \u00b6 Under the Tools menu -> Bulk Command you can execute a command against Clients/Sites/Selected Agents/All based on All/Servers/Workstations. The history is saved in the history tab of the agent. The history can also be retrieved from the API from the /agents/history/ endpoint. Automated Tasks \u00b6 Tactical RMM allows scheduling tasks to run on agents. This leverages the Windows Task Scheduler and has the same scheduling options. See Automated Tasks for configuring automated tasks. Script Checks \u00b6 Scripts can also be run periodically on an agent and trigger an alert if it fails in case you want any kind of warning code to alert you. Important: When utilizing PowerShell scripts and manually assigning an exit code, it's essential to define the exit code using the following syntax: $host.SetShouldExit(EXITCODE) . Here, EXITCODE represents the desired exit code number. For instance, to assign an exit code of 3, use $host.SetShouldExit(3) . Alert Failure/Resolve Actions \u00b6 Scripts can be triggered when an alert is triggered and resolved. For configuring Alert Templates , see Alerting See below for populating dashboard data in scripts and the available options. Using dashboard data in scripts \u00b6 Tactical RMM allows passing in dashboard data to scripts as arguments or environment variables. The below PowerShell arguments will get the client name of the agent and also the agent's public IP address. -ClientName {{client.name}} -PublicIP {{agent.public_ip}} Info Everything between {{}} is CaSe sEnSiTive See a full list of possible built-in variables Here Getting Custom Field values \u00b6 Tactical RMM supports pulling data from custom fields using the {{model.custom_field_name}} syntax. See Using Custom Fields in Scripts . Getting values from the Global Keystore \u00b6 Tactical RMM supports getting values from the global key store using the {{global.key_name}} syntax. See Global Keystore . Script Snippets \u00b6 Script Snippets allow you to create common code blocks or comments and apply them to all of your scripts. This could be initialization code, common error checking, or even code comments. Adding Script Snippets \u00b6 In the dashboard, browse to Settings > Scripts Manager . Click the Script Snippets button. Name - This identifies the script snippet in the dashboard Description - Optional description for the script snippet Shell - This sets the language of the script. Available options are: PowerShell Windows Batch Python Using Script Snippets \u00b6 When editing a script, you can add template tags to the script body that contains the script snippet name. For example, if a script snippet exists with the name \"Check WMF\", you would put {{Check WMF}} in the script body and the snippet code will be replaced. Info Everything between {{}} is CaSe sEnSiTive The template tags will only be visible when Editing the script. When downloading or viewing the script code the template tags will be replaced with the script snippet code.

OS Version Windows >= 8.1 3.11.9 Windows < 8.1 3.8.7 The following 3rd party packages are also bundled with this distribution: cryptography httpx msgpack psutil pysnmplib pywin32 pywin32-ctypes requests websockets WMI validators Python on posix \u00b6 How do you target a specific version? The shebang can specify the interpreter on macOS and Linux, but since Windows does not use the shebang, the interpreter needs to be specified by the calling program. Ok, so how do you use the shebang? Take this hello world script for example. The shebang #! in this script will use /usr/bin/python3 . This is easy enough until you run across a system where the system Python is not the expected 3.8 or later. #!/usr/bin/python3 print ( \"Hello World!\" ) This is where env comes into play. env will search the $PATH for the executable that matches the argument. In this case, the script will be run by the first \"python3\" found in $PATH. However, what if python3 points to python3.6 ? You're in the same boat you were in before. #!/usr/bin/env python3 print ( \"Hello World!\" ) Or are you? If you read the env man page , it states you can add parameters to the command line. In case you didn't know, the shebang is the command line! env will modify the $PATH before searching for python3 , allowing you to use a custom python location. #!/usr/bin/env PATH=\"/opt/my-python/3.8/:$PATH\" python3 print ( \"Hello World!\" ) Wait! Isn't the shebang a shell script, not a Python script? In TRMM, a \"Shell\" script and a \"Python\" script are treated the same except that Python scripts also work on Windows. On Linux and macOS, \"Shell\" and \"Python\" scripts are treated the same.

Because of the compilation step, errors due to language constructs introduced in a later version of Python will cause the script to fail. For example, Python 3.10 introduced the \"match\" term as their version of a case or switch statement. #!/usr/bin/env python3 match \"term\" : case \"Nope\" : print ( \"No match found\" ) case \"term\" : print ( \"Found match!\" ) case _ : print ( \"Default if nothing matches\" ) The same code will work on Python 3.10. $ python3.10 test-python-version.py Found match!

Restart the services: sudo systemctl restart nginx meshcentral rmm daphne Use NATS Standard instead of NATS websocket \u00b6 Prior to TRMM v0.14.0 (released 7/7/2022), agents NATS traffic connected to the TRMM server on public port 4222. If you have upgraded to v0.14.0 and have agents that won't work with websockets for some reason (too old TLS etc) then you can do the following to use NATS standard TCP on port 4222, just like how it was before v0.14.0: For Windows agents: Add the following registry string value (REG_SZ): HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\TacticalRMM\\NatsStandardPort with value 4222 Then restart the tacticalrmm Windows service. For Linux agents: Add the following key/value pair to /etc/tacticalagent : { \"natsstandardport\" : \"4222\" } Then sudo systemctl restart tacticalagent.service Just make sure port 4222 TCP is still open in your firewall and you're done. Configuring Custom Temp Dirs on Windows Agents \u00b6 Version added: Tactical RMM v0.15.10 Requires Agent v2.4.7 By default, the Windows agent utilizes the C:\\ProgramData\\TacticalRMM directory for executing scripts and managing agent updates. However, it is possible to override this default directory by setting two optional registry string values ( REG_SZ ), specifying full paths to the desired directories: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\TacticalRMM\\WinTmpDir : This registry value is used for running scripts and handling agent updates. Provide the full path to the custom directory. HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\TacticalRMM\\WinRunAsUserTmpDir : This registry value is specifically for executing Run As User scripts. Provide the full path to the custom directory. Please note that these custom directories must already exist on the system, as the agent will not attempt to create them. Ensure that the desired directories are created and that the appropriate permissions are set before adding the registry values. Directory path cannot contain spaces, this is a known issue and will be fixed in a future release. To apply the changes, restart the tacticalrmm Windows service. The custom temporary directories will then be used for the respective tasks. Example: Monitor NATS via its HTTP API \u00b6 Version added: Tactical RMM v0.15.1 To enable NATS monitoring , add the folllowing to /rmm/api/tacticalrmm/tacticalrmm/local_settings.py (replace with whatever port you want). NATS_HTTP_PORT = 8222 Then from the TRMM Web UI, do Tools > Server Maintenance > Reload Nats Configuration . And then from your TRMM server cli restart both the rmm.service and nats.service services. Modify the Placeholder Text for the 'Send Command' Functionality \u00b6 Version added: Tactical RMM v0.15.12 Users now have the flexibility to customize the placeholder text that is displayed in the 'Send Command' dialog. This customization can be achieved by defining any or all of the following three optional variables in /rmm/api/tacticalrmm/tacticalrmm/local_settings.py file: CMD_PLACEHOLDER_TEXT = \"<Your customized command prompt text>\" POWERSHELL_PLACEHOLDER_TEXT = \"<Your customized PowerShell prompt text>\" SHELL_PLACEHOLDER_TEXT = \"<Your customized shell prompt text>\" To activate, restart the api with sudo systemctl restart rmm and then refresh the web interface. Define a root user to prevent changes from web UI \u00b6 To define a \"root\" user who cannot be modified via the web UI, add the following line to /rmm/api/tacticalrmm/tacticalrmm/local_settings.py ROOT_USER = \"username\" Replace \"username\" with the actual username. After making this change, run sudo systemctl restart rmm.service to apply the changes. Adjusting Agent Check-In Intervals \u00b6 The agent periodically communicates with the RMM server, sending various data about its status and environment at random intervals. These randomized intervals are designed to prevent the \"thundering herd\" problem, where too many agents would check in simultaneously, potentially overloading the server. You can modify these intervals by adding one or more of the following variables to /rmm/api/tacticalrmm/tacticalrmm/local_settings.py . Each variable is a Python tuple containing two values: the minimum and maximum interval times, specified in seconds. The agent will select a random interval within this range for each check-in. The default check-in intervals are as follows: CHECKIN_HELLO = ( 30 , 60 ) # Agent heartbeat (\"I'm alive\") CHECKIN_AGENTINFO = ( 200 , 400 ) # System info (logged-in user, boot time, RAM, etc.) CHECKIN_WINSVC = ( 2400 , 3000 ) # Windows services and their status CHECKIN_PUBIP = ( 300 , 500 ) # Agent's public IP address CHECKIN_DISKS = ( 1000 , 2000 ) # Disk information and usage CHECKIN_SW = ( 2800 , 3500 ) # Installed Windows software list CHECKIN_WMI = ( 3000 , 4000 ) # Asset details (as seen in the \"Assets\" tab) CHECKIN_SYNCMESH = ( 800 , 1200 ) # Agent's Mesh node ID By adjusting these intervals, you can control how frequently the agent checks in with the RMM server for different types of data. This flexibility allows for balancing between server load and the frequency of updates. After adding any of these settings, you must restart both the RMM service ( sudo systemctl restart rmm ) and the agent service. An easy way to restart the agent service is by using the \"Tools > Recover All Agents\" function in the TRMM web UI. Configuring Agent Check Jitter \u00b6 Version added: v1.0.0 To prevent the thundering herd problem, where multiple agents send their check results simultaneously and overwhelm the server, a random jitter has been introduced. By default, this jitter is a random delay between 1 and 60 seconds. To customize this behavior, add the following variable to /rmm/api/tacticalrmm/tacticalrmm/local_settings.py and adjust the values as needed, then restart the RMM service ( sudo systemctl restart rmm ): CHECK_INTERVAL_JITTER = ( 1 , 60 )","title":"Overriding / Customizing Default Settings"},{"location":"functions/settings_override/#overriding-customizing-default-settings","text":"","title":"Overriding / Customizing Default Settings"},{"location":"functions/settings_override/#admin-user-browser-token-expiration-and-idle-timeout-settings","text":"The browser token expiration for admin users determines how long a session remains active before requiring re-authentication.
